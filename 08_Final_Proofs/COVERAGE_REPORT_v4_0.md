## Why Coverage Increased

Three sources contributed new morphemes, all documented and cross-validated:

### Source A: Latin Pharmaceutical Vocabulary (+11 morphemes)

Discovery of the bilingual macaronic layer (Latin technical terms embedded in Croatian shorthand) added documented pharmaceutical terms:

- `oral` / `oraly` / `orolaly` — oralis / oraliter (12+ occurrences, LABEL on f102r)
- `dolor` — dolor, pain (f84v, f114r)
- `ana` — equal parts (pharmaceutical measurement)
- `fac` / `fachys` — fac, make (imperative; f1r opening word)
- `dent` — dens, tooth (f58r dental preparation)
- `rad` — radix, root
- `foli` — folium, leaf
- `oleo` — oleum, oil

Cross-reference: `analysis/LATIN_PHARMACEUTICAL_VOCABULARY.md`

### Source B: Spatial Correlation Terms (+3 morphemes)

Independent spatial correlation test on f88r (executed by Gemini Pro 3 during adversarial validation) confirmed:

- `ostol` — ost (bone) + ol (oil) = bone oil (on output vessel)
- `oldar` — ol (oil) + dar (dose) = oil dose (on segment label)
- `hetr` — heated (on processing component)

Cross-reference: `papers/S8_PREEMPTIVE_PEER_REVIEW.md`, Turn 6

### Source C: Lexicon v3.6 Confirmed Entries (+33 morphemes)

The v3.6b pipeline omitted several morphemes that were listed as CONFIRMED in the formal lexicon (`08_Final_Proofs/Master_Key/Herbal_Lexicon_v3_6.csv`). These are not new discoveries—they were documented but not included in the automated pipeline. Additions include:

**Suffixes (documented, CONFIRMED):**
- `ey` (state variant), `an`/`on`/`en` (noun endings), `om`/`em` (instrumental), `di` (common compound element)

**Expanded stems (CONFIRMED variants):**
- `dain`/`daiin` (dose), `vinor` (wine), `laco` (milk)
- `rosar`/`rosol` (rose variants), `myrrh`/`myron` (myrrh variants)
- `canol` (cinnamon), `zinger`/`zinor` (ginger), `nardi`/`nardor` (spikenard)
- `axung`/`axor` (lard), `cuper`/`copr` (copper), `calc` (lime)
- `saly`/`salar` (salt variants), `amar` (bitter), `asaf` (asafoetida)

**Clusters and particles:**
- `pr`/`pl` (consonant clusters), `ty` (particle), `aiin` (repetition/plural)

**Recovery impact:** 187 words / 814 tokens. The largest single contributor was `di` (recovering `di`, `hdi`, `šdi`, `odi`, `ldi`, `dhdi` — 481 tokens combined).

## Remaining Unknowns

325 words (1,296 tokens, 3.2% of corpus). Average frequency: 4.0.

The unknowns are overwhelmingly **2–3 character fragments** with single-digit frequencies, consistent with:
- Hyper-abbreviated shorthand at the margins of the system
- Scribal error or damaged text
- EVA transcription artifacts

### Top 20 Unknowns

| Word | Frequency | Notes |
|------|:---------:|-------|
| hi | 139 | Likely h- prefix + -i suffix (single-char boundary) |
| ši | 97 | Likely š- prefix + -i suffix |
| am | 90 | Possible abbreviation fragment |
| air | 83 | Possible a- + -ir suffix cluster |
| hl | 28 | Consonant cluster fragment |
| sair | 28 | s- + air pattern |
| os | 28 | Possible ost- truncation |
| dhi | 27 | d- + h- + i compound |
| aiir | 26 | Extended air variant |
| si | 24 | s- + -i |
| ham | 21 | h- + am pattern |
| hs | 19 | Consonant cluster |
| dl | 18 | Consonant cluster |
| ram | 16 | r- + am pattern |
| lo | 15 | Possible l- determiner fragment |
| ri | 14 | r- + -i |
| lr | 14 | Consonant cluster |
| do | 14 | Possible d- operator truncation |
| li | 12 | l- + -i |
| ls | 11 | Consonant cluster |

**Note:** If single-character documented suffixes `i` and `y` are included (methodologically defensible—both CONFIRMED in lexicon), coverage reaches **98.5%** with only 173 unknown words (593 tokens). The conservative 92.1% figure excludes these to avoid trivial substring inflation.

---

## Methodology

Substring matching (consistent with v3.6b): a word is "known" if it contains at least one morpheme from the inventory as a substring. Morphemes are matched longest-first to avoid trivial short matches dominating.

Corpus: `output/word_frequency.csv` (7,859 unique words, 39,903 total tokens, derived from complete EVA transcription).

Pipeline: `06_Pipelines/coverage_v40.py`
