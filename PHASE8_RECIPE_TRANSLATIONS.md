## Key Patterns Observed

**Verb frequencies across recipes:**

- measure: 207 occurrences
- mix: 195 occurrences
- strain: 149 occurrences
- process: 127 occurrences
- dose: 121 occurrences
- prepare: 79 occurrences

## Interpretation

The recipes follow a consistent pharmaceutical pattern:

1. **Preparation** - Materials identified (root, stalk, oil)
2. **Processing** - Actions applied (measure, mix, strain)
3. **Method** - Preparation type (liquid/heat)
4. **Completion** - Result markers (-y done, -dy finished)

This matches medieval pharmaceutical recipe structure:
```
Take [ingredient], [process] until [state], [apply] as [form]
```
