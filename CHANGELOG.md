This document tracks the evolution of the decipherment from initial hypothesis to validated solution.

## Version History

### v3.6 - February 2, 2026 (Current)
**"Friday's Framework"**

- **Coverage**: 74% → **96.8%** (+20.7%)
- **Known morphemes**: 71 → 94 → 141 (+47 in v4.0)

**Key additions:**
- State markers (he-, heo-, še-, šeo-) distinguished from operators
- Medical bone register (ost-) identified alongside Slavic (kost-)
- Aspect distinction in suffixes: -edi (active) vs -ei (state)
- Gallows clusters (ctr, st, tr) systematized

**Documentation:**
- GETTING_STARTED.md tutorial
- FOLIO_INDEX.md (225 folios classified)
- CASE_STUDIES.md (5 detailed examples)
- PHARMACEUTICAL_TRANSLATIONS.md (complete f87r-f102v)
- FAQ.md and METHODOLOGY.md

---

### v3.5 - January 31, 2026
**"The Bone Breakthrough"**

- **Coverage**: ~65% → 74%
- First systematic recognition of kost- (bone) morpheme family
- Native speaker validation by Georgie Zuger
- Complete 179-page Croatian translation generated

**Key findings:**
- "kostedi" = bone preparation (693 occurrences)
- "kostain" = bones plural (630 occurrences)
- Pharmaceutical section identification confirmed

---

### v3.0 - January 2026
**"Validation Pipeline"**

- Preregistered falsification criteria established
- Phase 1-9 validation protocol implemented
- CATMuS medieval Latin comparison (68.6% stem match)
- Statistical baseline comparisons (JSD scores)

**Validation results:**
- Spatial correlation significant (p<0.001)
- Entropy profile matches pharmaceutical texts
- Recipe structure identified

---

### v2.0 - December 2025
**"Operator-Stem-Suffix"**

- Functional classification system developed
- Operators identified: qo-, ch-, sh-, da-
- Suffix patterns mapped: -ain, -edi, -ol, -ar, -al
- Gallows expansion hypothesis: k→st, t→tr

**Key insight:**
Statistical analysis showed word-initial operators constrain following elements, matching agglutinative language patterns.

---

### v1.0 - September 2025
**"Glagolitic Hypothesis"**

- Behavioral paleographic comparison initiated
- Angular Glagolitic identified as source tradition
- Croatian language hypothesis proposed
- Initial character mapping attempted

**Eureka moment:**
Comparing Hrvoje's Missal (1404) to Voynich f88r revealed consistent stroke logic despite shape divergence.

---

### v0.x - 2024-2025
**"Exploratory Phase"**

- Literature review of previous decipherment attempts
- Analysis of why Bax, Cheshire, and others failed
- Development of behavioral vs. shape-based paleography distinction
- Identification of Western scholarly blind spot (no Glagolitic comparison)

---

## Falsification Attempts

The following hypotheses were tested and **rejected**:

| Hypothesis | Test | Result |
|------------|------|--------|
| Latin cipher | Morpheme matching | 0% match |
| Hebrew cipher | Morpheme matching | 0% match |
| Arabic cipher | Morpheme matching | 0% match |
| Constructed language | Native validation | Rejected |
| Random/hoax | Statistical structure | Rejected |
| Old Church Slavonic | Grammar patterns | Poor fit |
| Slovenian | Vocabulary match | Poor fit |

**Croatian survived all falsification attempts.**

## Error Corrections

| Version | Error | Correction |
|---------|-------|------------|
| v3.5 | "Georgina Zuger" | Corrected to "Georgie Zuger" |
| v3.0 | k→sk expansion | Corrected to k→st |
| v2.0 | sh- as "she" | Corrected to š- (Croatian orthography) |
