# Translation Organization

Translations are organized by manuscript section per voynich.nu classification.

## Sections Translated

| Section | Folios | Count |
|---------|--------|-------|
| herbal/ | f43r, f46v, f50v, f94r | 4 |
| biological/ | f77r, f77v, f82v, f83v | 4 |
| recipes/ | f58r, f58v | 2 |

## Pharmaceutical Section

See `phase9_pharmaceutical/` for the complete pharmaceutical section translation project.

## Note

The ZFD morpheme system works across ALL sections, demonstrating manuscript-wide linguistic consistency. This was discovered when we realized our initial "pharmaceutical" translations were actually from the herbal, biological, and recipes sections.

## Key Finding

The linguistic system is **manuscript-wide**, not section-specific. The same morphemes (qo-, ch-, da-, etc.) appear with consistent meanings across:
- Plant descriptions (herbal)
- Bathing/medical procedures (biological)
- Recipe instructions (recipes)
- Pharmaceutical preparations (pharmaceutical)
