## 2. Layout Description (Visual Analysis)

### 2.1 Page Structure

Folio 3r follows the **standard herbal section layout** with a dominant plant illustration and wrapping text blocks. This is an early folio in the manuscript, providing a baseline for herbal section writing conventions.

**Layout zones:**

| Zone | Content | Position |
|------|---------|----------|
| Left | Three text blocks with paragraph breaks | Left third of page |
| Right/center | Large plant illustration | Dominating right two-thirds |
| Right margin | Labels near plant parts | Adjacent to illustration |
| Upper right | Page number "3" | Corner notation |

### 2.2 Plant Illustration

The dominant illustration is a large botanical rendering occupying the right side of the page:

- **Leaves:** Distinctive layered/striped leaves with alternating red and green coloring, producing a fern-like or scaled appearance. The layered structure is visually striking and unlike simpler leaf renderings elsewhere in the herbal section.
- **Stem:** A single central stem connects the leaf mass to the root system
- **Root:** Visible root structure at the base of the plant, rendered in brown/tan
- **Scale:** The plant extends from near the bottom to near the top of the page, occupying approximately two-thirds of the page width
- **Style:** Consistent with early herbal section botanical illustration conventions

### 2.3 Text Distribution

Text appears in **three blocks on the left side** of the page, with the text wrapping around the plant illustration:

- **Text block 1 (upper):** Several lines of text positioned above the widest part of the illustration. Line length constrained on the right by the plant's leaf mass.
- **Text block 2 (middle):** Shorter text block in the middle area, squeezed between the plant's upper and lower portions.
- **Text block 3 (lower):** Text block below the main leaf mass, with slightly longer lines as the illustration narrows toward the root.

Some paragraph breaks are visible between the text blocks, suggesting distinct content units (possibly describing different aspects of the plant or its uses).

### 2.4 Labels

Labels appear on the **right margin** near specific plant parts:
- Labels are short (typically 1-2 words)
- Positioned adjacent to the leaves, stem, or root they describe
- Written in a slightly more careful register than the body text
- Spatially correlated with specific botanical features of the illustration

### 2.5 Page Number

The number "3" is visible in the upper right corner (later foliation).

## 3. Writing Characteristics Observed

### 3.1 General Hand Quality

The writing on f3r is in **standard register** -- fluent, well-practiced writing consistent with the scribe's normal herbal-section hand. As an early folio (following the more carefully written f1r), f3r settles into the working pace that characterizes most of the herbal section.

### 3.2 Text-Illustration Integration

Text wraps smoothly around the plant illustration:
- Line lengths vary to accommodate the illustration's profile
- The scribe adjusts naturally to the available space without visible hesitation
- Text and illustration appear contemporaneous (no evidence of sequential addition)
- The integration follows the same convention seen throughout the herbal section

### 3.3 Baseline and Line Management

- **Baseline:** Consistent within each text block. Slight natural variation but no significant drift.
- **x-height:** Standard 2-3mm, consistent with early herbal folios.
- **Line spacing:** Regular at approximately 6-8mm baseline-to-baseline.
- **Left margin:** Well-defined, with consistent alignment across all three text blocks.
- **Right margin:** Variable, defined by the plant illustration's profile.

### 3.4 Word Spacing

Standard spacing throughout. Word boundaries are clear and unambiguous in the body text. Label spacing is slightly more generous, consistent with the careful-register treatment of labels across the manuscript.

### 3.5 Ink and Pen

- Body text in standard brown/sepia iron gall ink
- Pen nib consistent with the rest of the manuscript: moderate broad nib (~0.5-1mm), slight left oblique cut
- No visible ink batch changes within the folio
- Illustration pigments (red, green) are distinct from the text ink

## 4. Glyph Observations Specific to This Folio

### 4.1 Standard-Register Vowels

At the standard register observed in f3r:

- **EVA 'o':** Near-circular, fully closed. Consistent with the f1r reference standard but produced at a slightly more fluent pace. No ambiguity with 'a'.
- **EVA 'a':** Flowing circle-plus-tail. The rightward connector tail is well-formed and distinct. The circle portion is slightly less deliberate than f1r but still clearly differentiated from 'o'.
- **EVA 'e':** Crisp crescent form, stable throughout. Minimal speed variation -- one of the most reliable characters.
- **EVA 'i':** Clear individual strokes. In 'aiin' sequences, the minims are connected by pen movement but remain distinguishable.
- **EVA 'y':** Full descender with clear leftward curve. Descender length is near-maximum, consistent with standard register in early folios.

### 4.2 Standard-Register Consonants

- **EVA 'r':** Hook clearly formed. No ambiguity with 'i' or 'n' at standard speed.
- **EVA 'n':** Final-position minims well-spaced. Word boundaries after 'n' are clear.
- **EVA 'l':** Height distinction from 'i' is well-maintained. Easy to distinguish at this speed.
- **EVA 'd':** Full loop-plus-ascender construction. The baseline loop is open and clear, with the ascender reaching intermediate height.

### 4.3 Gallows Characters

- **EVA 'k' (k-gallows):** Well-formed loop at top. Vertical stem straight and tall. Loop geometry clearly distinguishable from t-gallows at standard speed.
- **EVA 't' (t-gallows):** Angular or offset loop clearly distinct from k-gallows.
- **EVA 'f' (f-gallows):** Full construction rendered, though with slightly more fluid execution than f1r.
- **EVA 'p' (p-gallows):** Distinctive loop orientation visible. Less frequent than k and t.

### 4.4 Operator Characters

- **EVA 'ch':** Written as a flowing two-part unit. The crescent-to-h transition is smooth but still distinguishable.
- **EVA 'sh':** Three visual components merge into a fluid sequence.
- **EVA 'qo':** Written as a fluid unit. The q-descender and o-circle are distinguishable at standard speed.

### 4.5 Label Glyphs

Labels near the plant parts show slightly more careful construction:
- Character forms are crisper than in the body text
- Word spacing is more generous
- Gallows loops are more precisely drawn
- This careful-label vs. standard-text distinction is consistent with the dual-register pattern observed in pharmaceutical folios

## 5. Speed / Ductus Notes

### 5.1 Speed Register

**Standard register throughout the body text.** Labels show careful register.

Evidence for standard register in body text:
- Fluent, rhythmic writing with consistent character proportions
- Ligature shortcuts visible (ch, sh, aiin written as units)
- Gallows constructed with practiced fluency
- Word spacing slightly tighter than f1r but still clear
- Full descender extension on 'y' (early folio, not yet showing the compression seen in later rapid-register folios)

### 5.2 Ductus Observations

At standard speed in f3r:
- **'aiin' ligature:** Continuous pen movement clearly established. The a-circle-tail flows into the minim sequence as a practiced unit.
- **Gallows:** Constructed with moderate fluency -- more practiced than f1r's deliberate two-stroke process but not yet the automatic gesture seen at rapid speed.
- **'ch'/'sh':** Fluid pen movements with minimal internal lifts.
- **'d':** Baseline loop drawn with fluid counterclockwise motion, ascending stroke rising smoothly from the loop.

### 5.3 Early Folio Character

As the third folio in the manuscript, f3r may preserve features of the scribe's initial working habits:
- The writing is well-settled into standard register (the careful-register deliberation of f1r has relaxed)
- Character forms are fully established and consistent
- The scribe is comfortable with the text-illustration integration conventions
- No evidence of the scribe "warming up" -- professional consistency from the outset

## 6. Abbreviation Marks Observed

### 6.1 Gallows Abbreviations

Standard gallows abbreviation patterns present:
- **k-gallows** (/-st-/ or /-sk-/): Present in medial position within stem words
- **t-gallows** (/-tr-/ or /-tv-/): Present in medial position, consistent with herbal vocabulary
- **f-gallows** (/-pr-/ or /-fr-/): Present but less frequent
- **p-gallows** (/-pl-/ or /-sp-/): Present but least frequent

### 6.2 Operator Prefixes

Herbal text operators observed:
- **ch-** (action/directional): Frequent in body text
- **sh-** (comitative/with): Present, likely for preparation instructions
- **qo-** (quantity/relative): Present in body text
- **o-** (topic marker): Expected for botanical identification in labels
- **d-** (dative/directional): Appears as initial operator

### 6.3 Suffix Abbreviations

Standard suffix inventory present:
- **-y** (adjective): Frequent throughout both text blocks and labels
- **-aiin** (substance noun): Present, marking botanical/substance terms
- **-ar** (water/agent): Present in standard distribution
- **-or** (oil marker): Less frequent but present
- **-n**, **-l**, **-r**: Standard noun/agent endings

### 6.4 Herbal Section Abbreviation Patterns

The herbal section text may emphasize:
- Botanical identification terms (o- operator + plant-name stems)
- Descriptive adjectives (-y suffix) for plant properties
- Preparation references (ch- and sh- operators for usage instructions)
- The abbreviation density is standard -- neither as sparse as cosmological labels nor as dense as biological section text

## 7. Key EVA Lines for Reference

### 7.1 Text Block Characteristics

Specific EVA transcription lines for f3r should be extracted from the Takahashi transcription file. Key characteristics to note:

- Lines in the upper text block may be longer (above the widest part of the illustration)
- Lines adjacent to the widest part of the plant will be shortest
- Lines in the lower text block regain length as the illustration narrows toward the root
- Paragraph breaks between text blocks should be noted in the transcription

### 7.2 Label Content

Labels near the plant illustration should be extracted individually:
- Record spatial position relative to the plant part (leaf, stem, root)
- Note whether the label text corresponds to the type of plant part it is near
- Cross-reference with other herbal folio labels for vocabulary consistency

### 7.3 Expected Vocabulary

Based on the herbal section context:
- Plant names or descriptions
- Botanical feature terminology (leaf, root, flower, stem)
- Possible medicinal or usage descriptions in the text blocks
- Color or property descriptors using -y adjective suffix
- Vocabulary should be compared with other early herbal folios for consistency

## 8. Transcription-Relevant Notes

### 8.1 Early Herbal Baseline

Folio 3r is valuable as an **early herbal section baseline**:
- Establishes the standard herbal page layout (large plant + wrapping text)
- Provides reference character forms at standard register early in the manuscript
- Can be compared with later herbal folios (f33v, f56r) to detect any progressive changes in the scribe's hand
- The transition from f1r's careful register to f3r's standard register documents the scribe's shift from formal opening to working hand

### 8.2 Text-Illustration Layout Convention

f3r exemplifies the herbal section's consistent layout convention:
- Single large plant illustration on the right
- Text in blocks on the left, wrapping around the illustration
- Labels near plant parts on the right margin
- This layout is repeated throughout the herbal section with minor variations
- Documenting f3r's specific layout helps establish the section-wide template

### 8.3 Red-Green Layered Leaf Structure

The distinctive red/green striped layered leaves on f3r are visually unusual:
- This layered/scaled rendering style may indicate a specific plant type (fern, scaled leaves, or layered petals)
- The color combination (red and green alternating) is distinctive among herbal illustrations
- The decoded label near these leaves should be checked against botanical identification
- This illustration style may recur on other folios, enabling cross-referencing

### 8.4 Paragraph Break Analysis

The visible paragraph breaks between the three text blocks suggest:
- Distinct content units (possibly: identification, description, usage)
- The scribe organized herbal entries with internal structure
- Paragraph breaks should be preserved in transcription as structural markers
- Cross-referencing paragraph break patterns across herbal folios can reveal conventional entry organization

### 8.5 Early-Folio Scribe Consistency

As an early folio, f3r provides evidence for:
- The scribe's consistent working hand (standard register established by folio 3)
- Layout conventions present from the start of the herbal section
- Abbreviation system fully operational in early folios (not evolving over the course of writing)
- Professional quality throughout, with no evidence of learning curve or experimentation
