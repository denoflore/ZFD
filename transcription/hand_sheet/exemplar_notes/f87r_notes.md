## 2. Layout Description (Visual Analysis)

### 2.1 Page Structure

Folio 87r is a **hybrid pharmaceutical/herbal folio** where a large botanical illustration dominates the page and text wraps around it. This layout bridges the herbal and pharmaceutical sections.

**Primary layout zones:**

| Zone | Content | Position |
|------|---------|----------|
| Upper left | Text block (upper) | Top-left quadrant |
| Lower left | Text block (lower) | Bottom-left quadrant |
| Right/center | Large plant illustration | Dominating right two-thirds |
| Upper right | Small flowering plant | Upper right corner |

### 2.2 Plant Illustration (Primary)

The dominant illustration is a large botanical rendering occupying the right side and center of the page:
- **Leaves:** Broad green leaves, prominently displayed
- **Roots:** Orange/brown root structures at the base of the plant
- **Scale:** This is one of the larger single-plant illustrations in the pharmaceutical section, extending from near the top to the bottom of the page
- **Style:** Consistent with the manuscript's herbal illustration convention -- stylized but recognizable botanical form

### 2.3 Small Flowering Plant

A **small flowering plant** appears in the upper right corner of the folio. This secondary illustration is smaller and may represent a related herb, ingredient, or comparative specimen.

### 2.4 Text Distribution

Text appears in two main blocks on the left side of the page:

- **Upper text block:** Several lines of text positioned above or to the upper-left of the plant illustration. This block is constrained on the right by the plant's leaves.
- **Lower text block:** Several lines of text positioned below or to the lower-left of the plant illustration. Similarly constrained by the illustration.

The text **wraps around the plant illustration**, adjusting line length to accommodate the illustration's profile. Lines closer to the widest part of the plant are shorter; lines above or below the plant extend further to the right.

## 3. Writing Characteristics Observed

### 3.1 General Hand Quality

The writing on f87r is in **standard register** throughout -- neither the most careful nor the most rapid in the manuscript. This is consistent with body text in the pharmaceutical section.

### 3.2 Text-Illustration Integration

A key paleographic feature of f87r is the **smooth wrapping of text around the botanical illustration**:
- Line lengths vary to accommodate the plant outline
- The scribe adjusts naturally to the available writing space
- No evidence of text being added after the illustration (both appear contemporaneous)
- The writing maintains consistent baseline discipline despite variable line lengths
- Word boundaries remain clear even where lines are shortened

This suggests the illustration was either drawn first (with text added around it) or that the scribe planned the layout in advance. The integration is smooth enough to indicate an experienced scribe comfortable with mixed text-illustration pages.

### 3.3 Baseline and Line Management

- **Baseline:** Consistent within each text block. No significant wandering despite the line-length variations.
- **x-height:** Standard 2-3mm, consistent with other pharmaceutical folios.
- **Line spacing:** Regular at ~6-8mm within each text block.
- **Margins:** Left margin is well-defined. Right margin varies with the plant illustration's profile.

### 3.4 Word Spacing

Standard spacing throughout. Word boundaries are generally clear, though some compressed words appear where line length is constrained by the illustration.

## 4. Glyph Observations Specific to This Folio

### 4.1 Standard-Register Characters

At the standard register observed in f87r:

- **EVA 'o':** Near-circular, fully closed. Slightly less perfect than f1r careful-register circles, but no ambiguity with 'a'.
- **EVA 'a':** Flowing circle-plus-tail. The tail connects smoothly to the next character. At standard speed, the circle portion may be slightly reduced compared to the f1r reference.
- **EVA 'e':** Stable crescent form. This character shows minimal speed variation even at standard register.
- **EVA 'i':** Clear individual strokes in isolation. In 'aiin' sequences, the minims are connected but distinguishable.
- **EVA 'y':** Moderate descender length. Shorter than the full descender seen at careful speed (f1r) but clearly distinct from 'i'.

### 4.2 Gallows Characters

- **Gallows general:** At standard register, gallows are slightly more fluid than in f1r labels but still well-formed. Loop geometry remains distinguishable for k vs. t gallows.
- **Construction speed:** The gallows are drawn with practiced fluency -- the pen lifts are shorter and the loop construction is more automatic than in careful register.

### 4.3 Operator Characters

- **EVA 'ch':** Written as a flowing unit. The crescent-to-h transition is continuous.
- **EVA 'sh':** Three components merge into a fluid sequence.
- **EVA 'qo':** Written as a single gestural unit at standard speed.

### 4.4 Edge-of-Illustration Characters

Where text abuts the illustration boundary, characters at line ends may show:
- Slight compression as the scribe reaches the illustration edge
- Occasionally truncated final characters or tighter word spacing
- These edge effects are minor but should be flagged in transcription

## 5. Speed / Ductus Notes

### 5.1 Speed Register

**Standard register throughout.** No systematic variation between the upper and lower text blocks.

Evidence for standard register:
- Fluent, rhythmic writing with consistent character proportions
- Ligature shortcuts visible (ch, sh, aiin as units)
- Gallows constructed with practiced fluency
- Word spacing slightly tighter than f1r but still clear
- Moderate descender length on 'y'

### 5.2 Ductus Observations

At standard speed:
- **'aiin' ligature:** Continuous pen movement is pronounced. The a-circle-tail flows directly into the minim sequence. This is clearly a practiced ligature.
- **Gallows:** Vertical stem and loop constructed in a single fluid gesture rather than the deliberate two-stroke process visible at careful speed.
- **'ch'/'sh':** Single fluid pen movements without discernible internal lifts.

### 5.3 Writing Rhythm

The writing on f87r shows a consistent rhythm -- the scribe maintains an even pace throughout both text blocks. There is no acceleration or deceleration corresponding to content changes. This suggests the scribe is copying from a model or composing from internalized knowledge at a steady pace.

## 6. Abbreviation Marks Observed

### 6.1 Gallows Abbreviations

Standard gallows abbreviation patterns present:
- **k-gallows** (/-st-/ or /-sk-/): Medial position in stem words
- **t-gallows** (/-tr-/ or /-tv-/): Medial position, consistent with pharmaceutical vocabulary
- **f-gallows** and **p-gallows**: Present but less frequent

### 6.2 Operator Prefixes

Pharmaceutical text operators observed:
- **ch-** (action/cook): Expected in recipe-context text
- **sh-** (comitative/soak): Expected for preparation instructions
- **da-** (dative/dose): Expected for dosage instructions
- **o-** (topic marker): Expected for ingredient identification
- **qo-** (quantity/relative): Expected for quantity descriptions

### 6.3 Suffix Abbreviations

Standard suffix inventory present:
- **-y** (adjective): Frequent in both text blocks
- **-aiin** (substance noun): Present, marking ingredient/substance terms
- **-edy** (processed/prepared): Expected in pharmaceutical context
- **-ol** (oil/liquid): Possible, given pharmaceutical content
- **-ar**, **-or** (agent/oil): Present in standard distribution

## 7. Key EVA Lines for Reference

### 7.1 Text Block Characteristics

The specific EVA transcription lines for f87r should be extracted from the Takahashi transcription file. Key characteristics to note during extraction:

- Lines in the upper text block may be longer (more space to the left of the plant)
- Lines adjacent to the widest part of the illustration will be shortest
- Lines in the lower text block regain length as the plant illustration narrows toward the roots

### 7.2 Expected Vocabulary

Based on the pharmaceutical section context and the botanical illustration:
- Plant identification terms (labels if any are present near the plant)
- Preparation/processing instructions using ch- and sh- operators
- Ingredient references with -aiin suffixes
- Possible vessel references (ost-, otr- stems) if the text describes processing

## 8. Transcription-Relevant Notes

### 8.1 Text-Illustration Wrapping Protocol

When transcribing f87r:
1. Record line-by-line, noting where each line's right boundary is constrained by the illustration
2. Use the EVA '<->' marker where the plant illustration interrupts a text line
3. Measure approximate line lengths to create a profile of the text-illustration boundary
4. Flag any characters at line ends that appear compressed or ambiguous due to illustration proximity

### 8.2 Comparison with Herbal Section

f87r's layout is transitional between the herbal and pharmaceutical sections:
- **Like herbal folios:** Single dominant plant illustration with wrapping text
- **Like pharmaceutical folios:** Located within the pharmaceutical section; vocabulary and content may be pharmaceutical rather than purely botanical
- This transitional character makes f87r valuable for comparing scribal behavior across sections

### 8.3 Secondary Plant Illustration

The small flowering plant in the upper right should be:
- Checked for any associated labels (these may be very small)
- Noted as a separate illustration element in the transcription record
- Considered as a possible cross-reference to the main plant illustration

### 8.4 Folio Number

The number "87" in the upper right corner is in a different hand (later foliation). This should be noted but not incorporated into the script analysis.

### 8.5 Standard Register Exemplar Value

f87r is a good exemplar for the **standard register** of pharmaceutical text because:
- The writing is consistent and representative
- The standard register is the most common across the manuscript
- Text wrapping around the illustration demonstrates scribal adaptability without speed change
- The folio can be directly compared with f1r (careful) and f77r (rapid) for register analysis
