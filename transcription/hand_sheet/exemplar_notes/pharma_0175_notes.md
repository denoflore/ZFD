## 2. Layout Description (Visual Analysis)

### 2.1 Page Structure

This folio follows the **standard pharmaceutical section layout**, closely paralleling f88r and f99r. The page combines stacked vessel illustrations, root/herb elements, and a large plant illustration with interspersed text blocks and labels.

**Layout zones:**

| Zone | Content | Position |
|------|---------|----------|
| Left margin | Stacked tiered vessel illustrations (multiple vessels) | Left edge, vertically arranged |
| Top/middle | Root and herb illustrations | Across upper and middle areas |
| Lower right | Large plant illustration with tentacle-like branches | Lower right quadrant |
| Between | Multiple text blocks | Interspersed among illustration areas |
| Near illustrations | Labels above roots and near vessels | Adjacent to specific illustration elements |

### 2.2 Vessel Illustrations (Left Margin)

Stacked tiered vessel illustrations along the left margin:
- **Multiple vessels:** Several distinct vessel forms arranged vertically, each with a tiered/stacked structure
- **Colors:** Red and brown vessel bodies with colored caps or lids (possibly blue, green, or gold tops distinguishing different vessel types)
- **Structure:** Multi-tiered containers consistent with the pharmaceutical apparatus convention seen on f88r and f99r
- **Variety:** The number of vessels on this page may exceed f88r, providing a larger sample of apparatus types
- **Style:** Consistent with the pharmaceutical section's vessel illustration conventions throughout

### 2.3 Root and Herb Illustrations (Top and Middle)

Root and herb illustrations distributed across the upper and middle portions of the page:
- **Roots:** Multiple root forms, rendered in brown/tan, positioned across the top of the page
- **Herbs:** Smaller herb or plant fragments among the root illustrations
- **Labels:** Labels positioned directly above individual root illustrations, identifying each root/herb by name
- **Distribution:** The root/herb illustrations span the available width between the left-margin vessels and the page edges

### 2.4 Large Plant Illustration (Lower Right)

A large plant illustration in the lower right portion of the page:
- **Branches:** Distinctive tentacle-like or spreading branches extending outward from a central stem
- **Color:** Green pigment for the branches/leaves
- **Form:** The tentacle-like branch structure is visually unusual -- the branches may represent a climbing plant, an aquatic plant with spreading fronds, or a specialized root/rhizome system
- **Scale:** Occupies approximately one quarter of the page area

### 2.5 Text Blocks

Multiple text blocks are distributed between the illustration areas:
- **Text block 1:** Between the vessel illustrations and the root area (upper left region)
- **Text block 2:** In the central area between roots/herbs and the lower plant illustration
- **Text block 3:** Additional text in remaining clear areas
- Text blocks are constrained by the surrounding illustrations, with variable line lengths
- The text blocks contain **recipe-format text**, consistent with the pharmaceutical section

### 2.6 Labels

Labels appear in two primary contexts:
- **Above roots:** Short labels (1-2 words) positioned directly above individual root/herb illustrations, identifying each ingredient
- **Near vessels:** Labels adjacent to specific vessel illustrations, identifying apparatus types
- Label placement follows the same spatial correlation convention as f88r and f99r

---

## 3. Writing Characteristics Observed

### 3.1 Dual-Register Writing

Consistent with the pharmaceutical section pattern observed on f88r and f99r:

- **Labels (careful register):** Deliberate, well-formed characters. Clear word boundaries. The labels above root illustrations are particularly carefully written, as they serve as unambiguous ingredient identifiers.

- **Body text (standard register):** Fluent pharmaceutical recipe text. Consistent with the standard register observed across the pharmaceutical section.

### 3.2 Pharmaceutical Section Writing Conventions

This folio confirms the pharmaceutical section's consistent writing conventions:
- Labels are always in careful register regardless of their position on the page
- Body text maintains standard register without speed variation
- The dual-register pattern is a section-wide scribal practice, not a page-specific choice
- Three pharmaceutical apparatus pages (f88r, f99r, and this page) all follow the same convention

### 3.3 Baseline and Line Management

- **Labels:** Horizontal baselines positioned above the illustrations they describe. Well-aligned and consistently placed.
- **Body text:** Standard horizontal baselines within text blocks. Line spacing regular at ~6-8mm. Text blocks have clear boundaries where they meet illustrations.
- **Multi-block consistency:** Baselines and spacing are consistent across all text blocks on the page despite their varying positions and widths.

### 3.4 Word Spacing

- **Labels:** Very clear word spacing with generous inter-word gaps. Each root label is typically isolated, with clear spatial separation from adjacent labels.
- **Body text:** Standard spacing, consistent with f88r and f99r body text. Word boundaries unambiguous in most instances.

### 3.5 Ink and Pen

- Body text and labels in standard brown/sepia iron gall ink
- Pen nib consistent with the pharmaceutical section standard
- No visible ink batch changes within the folio
- Illustration pigments (red, brown, green) are distinct from the text ink

## 4. Glyph Observations Specific to This Folio

### 4.1 Label Glyphs (Careful Register)

In the label text above roots and near vessels:
- **EVA 'o':** Fully circular, complete closure. Reference quality consistent with f88r labels.
- **EVA 'a':** Clear circle-plus-tail construction. Well-differentiated from 'o'.
- **Gallows:** Well-formed with full loop construction. k/t distinction clear at careful speed.
- **EVA 'l':** Clear height distinction from 'i'.
- **EVA 'r':** Hook well-formed.
- **EVA 'e':** Stable crescent, consistent.

### 4.2 Body Text Glyphs (Standard Register)

In the recipe text blocks:
- **EVA 'o':** Near-circular, fully closed. Standard quality.
- **EVA 'a':** Flowing circle-plus-tail. Standard execution.
- **EVA 'e':** Stable crescent. Minimal variation.
- **EVA 'i':** Clear strokes; connected in 'aiin' sequences.
- **EVA 'y':** Moderate descender length, standard register.
- **Gallows:** Fluid construction, loop geometry visible.

### 4.3 Pharmaceutical Vocabulary Glyphs

Specific glyph combinations expected, consistent with f88r and f99r:
- **'ok' sequences** (o + k-gallows): Expanding to "ost" for vessel/container terms
- **'ot' sequences** (o + t-gallows): Expanding to "otr" for treated/processed terms
- **'ch' initial:** Action operator introducing processing steps
- **'sh' initial:** Comitative operator introducing ingredient combinations
- **'da' initial:** Dative operator introducing dosage instructions

### 4.4 Cross-Folio Label Comparison

Labels on this page can be compared with f88r and f99r labels:
- Three-way label comparison provides the strongest evidence for scribal consistency in the pharmaceutical section
- Any new root labels not found on f88r or f99r expand the pharmaceutical vocabulary inventory
- Vessel labels can be correlated with vessel form variations to build an apparatus taxonomy
- Consistent glyph forms across three apparatus pages confirm the transcription method's reliability

## 5. Speed / Ductus Notes

### 5.1 Label Speed

**Careful register.** Labels are written with the same deliberation seen on f88r and f99r:
- Full character construction
- Clear pen lifts at expected positions
- No compression or shortcuts beyond the standard abbreviation system
- Root labels are particularly deliberate, suggesting importance as ingredient identifiers

### 5.2 Body Text Speed

**Standard register.** Recipe text written at comfortable, fluent pace:
- Consistent character proportions
- Smooth ligature execution
- Rhythmic pen movement
- No evidence of rushing or compression

### 5.3 Ductus Observations

- **'aiin' in recipe text:** Smooth ligature execution, standard quality.
- **Gallows in recipe text:** Practiced fluency in construction. Two-stroke pattern executed as confident gesture.
- **Operator prefixes:** 'ch' and 'sh' as fluid units, consistent with pharmaceutical section standard.
- **Label ductus:** Deliberate stroke construction. Each character formed individually with clear pen control.

### 5.4 Pharmaceutical Section Speed Consistency

Across three apparatus pages (f88r, f99r, and this page):
- The dual-register pattern (careful labels / standard body text) is perfectly consistent
- The speed transition between registers shows the same natural character
- No page shows evidence of greater or lesser care than the others
- This consistency further supports a single scribe working within established conventions

## 6. Abbreviation Marks Observed

### 6.1 Gallows Abbreviations

All four gallows types expected in pharmaceutical recipe text:

- **k-gallows** (/-st-/ or /-sk-/): Frequent. Vessel terms and processing terms.
- **t-gallows** (/-tr-/ or /-tv-/): Frequent. Treatment and instrument terms.
- **f-gallows** (/-pr-/ or /-fr-/): Present. Preparation-related vocabulary.
- **p-gallows** (/-pl-/ or /-sp-/): Present but least frequent.

### 6.2 Operator Prefixes

Pharmaceutical recipe operators:

| Operator | Expected Function in Recipe Context | Frequency Estimate |
|----------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| ch- | "Cook/combine" -- processing steps | HIGH |
| sh- | "With/soak" -- ingredient combinations | HIGH |
| da- | "Dose/give" -- administration instructions | MEDIUM |
| o- | Topic marker -- ingredient/product identification | HIGH |
| qo- | "Quantity/which" -- measurements or references | MEDIUM |

### 6.3 Suffix Abbreviations

Recipe-relevant suffixes:

| Suffix | Function in Recipe Context | Expected Frequency |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| -aiin | Substance noun (ingredient, preparation) | HIGH |
| -edy | Processed/prepared (past participle state) | HIGH |
| -y | Adjective/descriptor | HIGH |
| -ol | Oil/liquid marker | MEDIUM |
| -ar | Water/agent | MEDIUM |
| -or | Oil (variant) | MEDIUM |
| -am, -om | Instrumental case ("by means of") | MEDIUM |
| -n, -l, -r | Standard endings | HIGH |

### 6.4 Expanded Label Vocabulary

With three apparatus pages now analyzed, the cumulative label vocabulary can be assessed:
- Labels on this page may introduce new root/herb names not found on f88r or f99r
- New vessel labels may identify apparatus types not previously documented
- The expanded vocabulary supports more robust frequency analysis and decoding confidence
- Cross-page label comparison can identify repeated terms (same ingredient used in multiple recipes)

## 7. Key EVA Lines for Reference

### 7.1 Root/Herb Label Inventory

Labels above root illustrations should be systematically inventoried:
- Record each label's EVA transcription
- Map each label to its specific root/herb illustration
- Note the root's visual characteristics (shape, color, branching pattern)
- Cross-reference with f88r and f99r root labels for vocabulary overlap

### 7.2 Vessel Label Inventory

Labels near vessel illustrations should be inventoried:
- Record each label's EVA transcription
- Map each label to its specific vessel illustration
- Note the vessel's visual characteristics (tiers, colors, cap/lid form)
- Cross-reference with f88r labels (especially the validated "ostol")

### 7.3 Recipe Text Blocks

The body text blocks should be transcribed sequentially:
- Note which illustration elements each text block is adjacent to (context for recipe identification)
- Expected recipe structure: ingredients (o- prefix), processing (ch-/sh- prefix), dosage (da- prefix)
- Compare recipe structure with f88r and f99r text blocks

### 7.4 Expected Vocabulary

Based on the pharmaceutical section context:
- Vessel/container terms (ost-, otr- stems)
- Root/herb ingredient names
- Processing instructions
- The tentacle-branched plant in the lower right may have a distinctive label worth prioritizing

## 8. Transcription-Relevant Notes

### 8.1 Pharmaceutical Template Confirmation

This folio provides the **third instance** of the pharmaceutical apparatus page template:

| Feature | f88r | f99r | This page |
|---------|------|------|-----------|
| Vessel illustrations | Left margin, stacked | Left margin, stacked | Left margin, stacked (multiple) |
| Root/herb illustrations | Middle area | Top area | Top and middle areas |
| Plant illustrations | Right (branches) | Lower right | Lower right (tentacle branches) |
| Text blocks | Between illustrations | Between illustrations | Between illustrations (multiple) |
| Labels | Near roots and vessels | Near roots and vessels | Above roots, near vessels |
| Speed registers | Careful + Standard | Careful + Standard | Careful + Standard |

The three-page consistency confirms that the pharmaceutical section follows a deliberate, repeatable visual template. This template consistency:
- Validates the transcription approach (same methods apply to all apparatus pages)
- Enables systematic cross-page comparison
- Suggests the section was planned as a coherent unit

### 8.2 Label-Illustration Correlation Protocol

Apply the same spatial correlation protocol as f88r and f99r:
1. Map each label to its nearest illustration element
2. Classify the illustration type (vessel, root, herb, plant)
3. After decoding, verify semantic compatibility
4. Flag any spatial-semantic mismatches
5. Cross-reference with validated f88r labels for vocabulary anchoring

### 8.3 Tentacle-Branch Plant

The large plant illustration with tentacle-like branches in the lower right is visually distinctive:
- The spreading branch structure is unusual among the manuscript's botanical illustrations
- This form may represent a specific plant type (climbing plant, aquatic plant, or specialized root system)
- Any label associated with this plant is a candidate for botanical identification
- Compare the illustration style with other unusual plant forms in the herbal and pharmaceutical sections

### 8.4 Multiple Vessel Forms

The multiple vessel illustrations on this page may display greater variety than f88r or f99r:
- Different vessel forms (varying tier counts, cap/lid colors, sizes) may represent distinct apparatus types
- If different vessel forms have different labels, this establishes a vessel taxonomy within the pharmaceutical section
- Correlating vessel form with decoded label meaning is a high-priority validation task
- The colored caps/lids may indicate contents, function, or processing stage

### 8.5 Cumulative Pharmaceutical Vocabulary

With three apparatus pages analyzed, a cumulative pharmaceutical vocabulary can be built:
- Merge label inventories from f88r, f99r, and this page
- Identify repeated terms (same ingredient or apparatus appearing on multiple pages)
- Identify unique terms (ingredients or apparatus specific to one page)
- Calculate term frequencies across the pharmaceutical section
- Use the cumulative vocabulary to improve decoding confidence through frequency analysis

### 8.6 Integration with Validated Readings

The validated readings from f88r ("ostol" and "otrorhetri") provide anchor points:
- Look for the same terms or related vocabulary on this page
- If "ostol" appears as a label on this page, check whether it is associated with a similar vessel form
- Any vocabulary overlap with the validated labels strengthens decoding confidence
- Vocabulary divergence is expected (different recipes, different ingredients) and is not a concern unless structural patterns differ
