## 2. Layout Description (Visual Analysis)

### 2.1 Page Structure

Folio 99r follows the **standard pharmaceutical section layout**, closely paralleling f88r. The page combines vessel illustrations, botanical elements, and text blocks in a structured arrangement.

**Layout zones:**

| Zone | Content | Position |
|------|---------|----------|
| Left margin | Stacked colored vessel illustrations | Left edge, vertically arranged |
| Top | Root/herb illustrations | Across upper portion |
| Lower right | Plant illustration | Lower right area |
| Between | Three text blocks | Interspersed among illustrations |
| Near illustrations | Labels | Adjacent to roots and vessels |

### 2.2 Vessel Illustrations (Left Margin)

Stacked colored vessel illustrations along the left margin:
- **Form:** Tiered jars or containers, drawn with red and brown pigments
- **Structure:** Multi-tiered stacked arrangement, showing pharmaceutical apparatus
- **Style:** Consistent with f88r vessel illustrations -- the same apparatus convention used throughout the pharmaceutical section
- **Colors:** Red and brown are the primary pigments for the vessel outlines and fills

### 2.3 Root/Herb Illustrations (Top)

Across the top of the folio:
- Root and herb illustrations arranged horizontally
- Multiple root forms depicted, possibly different species or preparations
- Brown and tan rendering consistent with botanical illustration conventions
- Labels associated with individual root illustrations

### 2.4 Plant Illustration (Lower Right)

A plant illustration in the lower right area:
- Green leaves with botanical form
- Smaller than the f87r plant illustration but similar in style
- May represent an ingredient used in the recipes described in the text

### 2.5 Text Blocks

Three text blocks are distributed between the illustration areas:
- **Text block 1:** Between the top root illustrations and the middle vessel area
- **Text block 2:** In the central area, constrained by surrounding illustrations
- **Text block 3:** In the lower portion, between the vessels and the plant illustration

These text blocks contain **recipe-format text** -- pharmaceutical instructions for preparation, processing, and administration.

### 2.6 Labels

Labels appear near:
- Individual root/herb illustrations (identifying the ingredients)
- Vessel illustrations (identifying apparatus types)
- These labels are short (typically 1-2 words) and spatially correlated with their referent illustrations

### 2.7 Page Number

The number "99" is visible on the page (later foliation).

## 3. Writing Characteristics Observed

### 3.1 Dual-Register Writing

Consistent with the pharmaceutical section pattern (as seen in f88r):

- **Labels (careful register):** Deliberate, well-formed characters. Clear word boundaries. Labels serve as identifiers and must be unambiguously readable.

- **Body text (standard register):** Fluent pharmaceutical recipe text. Consistent with the standard register observed across the pharmaceutical section (comparable to f87r body text).

### 3.2 Recipe Text Structure

The body text blocks on f99r likely follow a **recipe format**:
- Ingredient identification (using botanical terms, possibly with o- operator prefixes)
- Preparation instructions (using ch- action operator, sh- comitative operator)
- Dosage information (using da- dative operator)
- Processing state descriptions (using -edy suffix for "prepared/processed")

This recipe structure creates a predictable vocabulary and abbreviation pattern that can aid transcription.

### 3.3 Baseline and Line Management

- **Labels:** Horizontal baselines, well-aligned, generous spacing between the label and the illustration it describes.
- **Body text:** Standard horizontal baselines. Line spacing is regular (~6-8mm). Text blocks have well-defined boundaries where they meet illustrations.
- **Overall consistency:** Consistent with pharmaceutical section norms.

### 3.4 Word Spacing

- **Labels:** Clear word spacing with generous inter-word gaps.
- **Body text:** Standard spacing. Word boundaries are generally clear, slightly more compressed than labels but unambiguous in most instances.

## 4. Glyph Observations Specific to This Folio

### 4.1 Label Glyphs (Careful Register)

In the label text near roots and vessels:
- **EVA 'o':** Fully circular, complete closure. Reference quality.
- **EVA 'a':** Clear circle-plus-tail construction.
- **Gallows:** Well-formed with full loop construction. k/t distinction clear at this speed.
- **EVA 'l':** Clear height distinction from 'i'.
- **EVA 'r':** Hook well-formed.

### 4.2 Body Text Glyphs (Standard Register)

In the recipe text blocks:
- **EVA 'o':** Near-circular, fully closed. Standard quality.
- **EVA 'a':** Flowing circle-plus-tail. Connecting smoothly within ligatures.
- **EVA 'e':** Stable crescent. Minimal variation.
- **EVA 'i':** Clear strokes in isolation; connected in 'aiin' sequences.
- **EVA 'y':** Moderate descender length, consistent with standard register.
- **Gallows:** Fluid construction, loop geometry visible.

### 4.3 Pharmaceutical Vocabulary Glyphs

Specific glyph combinations expected in pharmaceutical recipes:
- **'ok' sequences** (o + k-gallows): Expanding to "ost" (vessel/container terms)
- **'ot' sequences** (o + t-gallows): Expanding to "otr" (treated/vessel terms)
- **'ch' initial:** Action operator introducing processing instructions
- **'sh' initial:** Comitative operator introducing ingredient combinations
- **'da' initial:** Dative operator introducing dosage instructions

### 4.4 Comparison with f88r Labels

f99r labels can be directly compared with f88r labels:
- Same register (careful)
- Same context (pharmaceutical apparatus and botanical identification)
- Same spatial correlation pattern (label near illustration)
- Glyph forms should be highly consistent between the two folios
- Any differences would indicate either different content vocabulary or transcription uncertainty

## 5. Speed / Ductus Notes

### 5.1 Label Speed

**Careful register.** Labels are written with the same deliberation seen in f88r labels:
- Full character construction
- Clear pen lifts at expected positions
- No compression or abbreviation shortcuts beyond the standard system

### 5.2 Body Text Speed

**Standard register.** Recipe text is written at a comfortable, fluent pace:
- Consistent character proportions
- Smooth ligature execution
- Rhythmic pen movement indicating practiced writing
- No evidence of rushing or compression beyond standard norms

### 5.3 Ductus Observations

- **'aiin' in recipe text:** The ligature is executed smoothly at standard speed. The a-circle connects to the minim sequence via the rightward tail, and the minims are rhythmically produced.
- **Gallows in recipe text:** Constructed with practiced fluency. The two-stroke construction (stem + loop) is executed as a quick, confident gesture.
- **Operator prefixes:** 'ch' and 'sh' are written as fluid units, consistent with standard-register behavior across the manuscript.

## 6. Abbreviation Marks Observed

### 6.1 Gallows Abbreviations

All four gallows types expected in pharmaceutical recipe text:

- **k-gallows** (/-st-/ or /-sk-/): Frequent. Produces vessel terms (ost- = container) and processing terms.
- **t-gallows** (/-tr-/ or /-tv-/): Frequent. Produces treatment terms (otr- = treated/processed) and instrument references.
- **f-gallows** (/-pr-/ or /-fr-/): Present. Less frequent but expected in preparation-related vocabulary.
- **p-gallows** (/-pl-/ or /-sp-/): Present. Least frequent but may appear in compound terms.

### 6.2 Operator Prefixes

Pharmaceutical recipe operators:

| Operator | Expected Function in Recipe Context | Frequency Estimate |
|----------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| ch- | "Cook/combine" -- introduces processing steps | HIGH |
| sh- | "With/soak" -- introduces ingredient combinations | HIGH |
| da- | "Dose/give" -- introduces administration instructions | MEDIUM |
| o- | Topic marker -- identifies ingredients or products | HIGH |
| qo- | "Quantity/which" -- introduces measurements or references | MEDIUM |

### 6.3 Suffix Abbreviations

Recipe-relevant suffixes:

| Suffix | Function in Recipe Context | Expected Frequency |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| -aiin | Substance noun (ingredient, preparation) | HIGH |
| -edy | Processed/prepared (past participle state) | HIGH |
| -y | Adjective/descriptor | HIGH |
| -ol | Oil/liquid marker | MEDIUM |
| -ar | Water/agent | MEDIUM |
| -or | Oil (variant) | MEDIUM |
| -am, -om | Instrumental case ("by means of") | MEDIUM |
| -n, -l, -r | Standard endings | HIGH |

### 6.4 Compound Abbreviation Patterns

Recipe text frequently contains multi-layer abbreviation:
- **Operator + gallows-stem + suffix:** e.g., ch + ok + aiin = h + ost + ain (cooking/vessel/substance)
- **These compounds** produce full pharmaceutical terms from three abbreviated layers

## 7. Key EVA Lines for Reference

### 7.1 Label Inventory

Labels on f99r should be inventoried systematically:

1. **Root/herb labels (top):** Each root illustration may have an associated label. Extract and record each label's EVA transcription along with its spatial position relative to the specific root illustration.

2. **Vessel labels (left margin):** Labels near vessel illustrations may identify apparatus types. Cross-reference with f88r vessel labels for vocabulary consistency.

3. **Plant labels (lower right):** Any labels near the plant illustration in the lower right.

### 7.2 Recipe Text Blocks

The three body text blocks should be transcribed sequentially. Expected recipe structure:

- **Block 1:** Possibly ingredient identification and initial preparation
- **Block 2:** Processing instructions (middle steps)
- **Block 3:** Final preparation, dosage, or administration

This structure is hypothetical and should be tested against the actual decoded text.

### 7.3 Expected Vocabulary Overlap with f88r

Given the similar layout and section placement, f99r vocabulary should overlap significantly with f88r:
- Vessel terms (ost-, otr-)
- Processing verbs (ch- prefixed)
- Ingredient nouns (-aiin suffixed)
- Comparative analysis of vocabulary overlap can strengthen decoding confidence

## 8. Transcription-Relevant Notes

### 8.1 Parallel with f88r

f99r closely parallels f88r in layout and content type:

| Feature | f88r | f99r |
|---------|------|------|
| Vessel illustrations | Left margin, stacked tiered | Left margin, stacked tiered |
| Root/herb illustrations | Middle area with labels | Top area with labels |
| Plant illustrations | Right side (branches/leaves) | Lower right |
| Text blocks | Between illustrations | Between illustrations |
| Labels | Near roots and vessels | Near roots and vessels |
| Speed registers | Careful (labels) + Standard (text) | Careful (labels) + Standard (text) |

This parallel layout supports systematic comparison:
- Consistent label forms between f88r and f99r validate the transcription method
- Vocabulary differences may indicate different recipes or ingredients
- Layout consistency confirms section-wide scribal conventions

### 8.2 Label-Illustration Correlation Protocol

Apply the same spatial correlation protocol as f88r:
1. Map each label to its nearest illustration element
2. Classify the illustration type (vessel, root, herb, plant)
3. After decoding, verify semantic compatibility between label meaning and illustration type
4. Flag mismatches for review

### 8.3 Recipe Structure Analysis

f99r text blocks may exhibit recipe structure:
- Look for operator patterns that signal recipe steps (ch-, sh-, da- at word beginnings)
- Note any numerical or quantity indicators (qo- operator)
- Track the sequence of operators through the text to map the recipe's procedural flow
- Compare the recipe structure pattern with f88r text blocks

### 8.4 Vessel Illustration Comparison

The stacked tiered vessel illustrations on f99r should be compared with f88r vessels:
- Are the vessel forms identical or distinct?
- Do different vessel forms correspond to different label terms?
- The vessel taxonomy may help identify specific apparatus types in the ZFD decoding

### 8.5 Root/Herb Identification Potential

The root/herb illustrations at the top of f99r, combined with their labels, offer potential for:
- Botanical cross-identification (if illustrations can be matched to known plant species)
- Pharmacological context (which ingredients are associated with which recipes)
- Vocabulary validation (if a root illustration can be independently identified, the decoded label can be checked against the known name)

### 8.6 Integration with Pharmaceutical Section Analysis

f99r should be analyzed as part of the broader pharmaceutical section corpus:
- Compare with f88r (validated labels), f87r (plant-focused pharmaceutical), and other pharmaceutical folios
- Build a cumulative pharmaceutical vocabulary from all folios in the section
- Track recipe structure patterns across multiple folios to identify conventions
