## 2. Layout Description (Visual Analysis)

### 2.1 Page Structure

Folio 88r exemplifies the pharmaceutical section layout. The page is organized into three horizontal registers with integrated illustration and text.

**Three horizontal registers:**

| Register | Content | Position |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Top | Root/herb illustrations with labels above | Upper third of page |
| Middle | Stacked tiered vessel illustrations (left) + text blocks | Central third |
| Bottom | Additional vessel illustrations + text blocks | Lower third |

### 2.2 Illustration Types

Three distinct illustration categories appear on this folio:

1. **Stacked tiered vessel illustrations (left margin):** Red, green, and tan colored vessel forms arranged vertically along the left margin. These depict pharmaceutical apparatus -- multi-tiered containers, possibly distillation equipment, alembics, or storage vessels. The vessels are drawn with careful attention to their tiered/stacked structure, using alternating colors to distinguish components.

2. **Root/herb illustrations (middle area):** Botanical illustrations showing root systems and herb stems. These are positioned in the central portion of the page, typically between or below the vessel diagrams.

3. **Plant branches and leaves (right area):** Additional botanical elements on the right side of the page -- branches with leaves rendered in green and tan.

### 2.3 Text Distribution

Text appears in **blocks between illustration areas**, not as continuous paragraphs. The text blocks are:
- Constrained by the surrounding illustrations
- Variable in width depending on available space
- Interspersed with labels near specific illustration components

### 2.4 Labels

**Labels above root illustrations** are the most transcription-critical text on this folio. These labels:
- Are positioned directly above or adjacent to specific root/herb illustrations
- Are written in a slightly larger or more careful hand than body text
- Show spatial correlation with the illustration components they describe
- Include the validated readings "ostol" and "otrorhetri"

### 2.5 Page Number

The number "88" is visible in the upper right corner, consistent with the later foliation system applied to the manuscript.

## 3. Writing Characteristics Observed

### 3.1 Dual-Register Writing

This folio displays two distinct speed registers on the same page:

- **Labels (careful register):** Written with deliberate letterform construction. Clear word boundaries, well-formed gallows, full character proportions. The labels are designed to be read as identifiers for specific illustration components.

- **Body text (standard register):** Written at normal fluency. Slightly more compressed than f1r but still well-formed. Consistent with pharmaceutical recipe text throughout the section.

### 3.2 Baseline and Line Management

- **Labels:** Baseline follows a single line, generally horizontal, positioned above or beside the relevant illustration. Some labels follow slight curves to accommodate illustration placement.
- **Body text:** Standard horizontal baselines within text blocks. Line spacing is regular at ~6-8mm. Text blocks have clear left margins defined by adjacent illustrations.

### 3.3 Word Spacing

- **Labels:** Very clear word spacing. Each label is typically 1-3 words, with generous inter-word gaps.
- **Body text:** Standard spacing, slightly tighter than f1r but still unambiguous in most cases.

### 3.4 Spatial Correlation

A critical feature of f88r is the **spatial correlation between labels and apparatus components**. Labels are physically positioned near the illustration element they describe, creating a visual index system. This spatial relationship is essential for validation: the meaning implied by a label's decoded text should correspond to the visual content of the adjacent illustration.

## 4. Glyph Observations Specific to This Folio

### 4.1 Label Glyphs (Careful Register)

In the label text:
- **EVA 'o':** Perfectly circular, fully closed. Indistinguishable from f1r reference quality.
- **EVA 'a':** Clear circle-plus-tail. The tail is well-formed and distinct.
- **EVA 't' (t-gallows):** Full loop construction in labels. The t-gallows in "otrorhetri" is a key validation glyph -- its expansion to /-tr-/ produces the reading "otrorhetri" which Curio confirms.
- **EVA 'k' (k-gallows):** Clear loop geometry in labels where present.
- **EVA 'l':** Height distinction from 'i' is maintained at careful speed.
- **EVA 'r':** Hook clearly formed in label contexts.

### 4.2 Body Text Glyphs (Standard Register)

In the body text blocks:
- **EVA 'o':** Near-circular, still fully closed at standard speed.
- **EVA 'a':** Flowing circle-plus-tail; the tail connects smoothly to the following character.
- **Gallows:** Slightly more fluid construction than in labels, but still well-formed. Loop geometry remains distinguishable.
- **EVA 'aiin' ligature:** Continuous pen movement clearly visible. The minim sequence is rhythmically connected.

### 4.3 Specific Validated Glyphs

The following glyph sequences have external validation via Curio:

**"ostol" (label):**
- EVA: o-s-t-o-l
- Glyph breakdown: o (circle) + s (curve) + t-gallows (tall stem + loop) + o (circle) + l (tall minim)
- ZFD expansion: o + s + tr + o + l = "ostrol" (large vessel/container)
- The t-gallows is clearly formed with its characteristic angular/offset loop

**"otrorhetri" (label):**
- EVA: o-t-r-o-r-h-e-t-r-i
- Contains two t-gallows instances, both well-formed
- ZFD expansion produces a pharmaceutical apparatus term
- Curio confirmation provides the strongest external validation in the corpus

## 5. Speed / Ductus Notes

### 5.1 Label Ductus

Labels show the careful register:
- Deliberate stroke construction
- Clear pen lifts between characters where expected
- Full gallows loop completion
- No compression of character spacing

### 5.2 Body Text Ductus

Body text shows the standard register:
- Fluent, rhythmic writing
- Pen lifts reduced between connected characters
- Ligature shortcuts visible (ch, sh, aiin written as units)
- Gallows still fully constructed but drawn more quickly

### 5.3 Speed Transition

The transition between careful (label) and standard (body text) registers is visible on this single folio:
- Labels are isolated text fragments, allowing the scribe to slow down
- Body text requires sustained writing speed for longer passages
- The scribe transitions between registers naturally, suggesting this is a habitual working practice (not artifice)

## 6. Abbreviation Marks Observed

### 6.1 Gallows Abbreviations in Labels

- **t-gallows** (EVA 't'): Present in both validated labels. Expanding to /-tr-/ produces confirmed readings.
- **k-gallows** (EVA 'k'): Present in body text. Expanding to /-st-/ in standard contexts.

### 6.2 Operator Prefixes

- **o-** (topic marker): Appears word-initially in "ostol" and "otrorhetri" -- functioning as a topic/substance marker for pharmaceutical terms.
- **ch-** (action operator): Present in body text blocks.
- **sh-** (comitative operator): Present in body text.
- **qo-** (quantity/relative): Appears in body text.

### 6.3 Suffix Abbreviations in Labels

- **-ol** (oil/liquid marker): Terminal in "ostol" -- marking the vessel as associated with liquid/oil processing.
- **-y** (adjective marker): Present in body text.
- **-aiin** (substance noun): Present in body text blocks.

### 6.4 Compound Abbreviation Sequences

Body text blocks contain compound abbreviation sequences combining operators, gallows, and suffixes in the standard three-layer pattern: operator + gallows-expanded stem + suffix.

## 7. Key EVA Lines for Reference

### 7.1 Validated Labels

```
ostol
```
- **ZFD reading:** o + s + t(=tr) + o + l = "ostrol" (pharmaceutical vessel term)
- **Validation:** Confirmed by Curio
- **Spatial context:** Label positioned above/near a vessel illustration

```
otrorhetri
```
- **ZFD reading:** Complex pharmaceutical apparatus term
- **Validation:** Confirmed by Curio
- **Spatial context:** Label associated with specific apparatus component

### 7.2 Additional Labels

Multiple additional labels appear over root illustrations at the top of the folio. These have not yet received independent validation but should be transcribed with priority given their potential for cross-referencing against botanical identification of the root illustrations.

### 7.3 Body Text

Body text blocks contain pharmaceutical recipe text. Specific EVA transcription lines should be extracted from the Takahashi or other standard transcription files for this folio and cross-referenced against the ZFD decoder output.

## 8. Transcription-Relevant Notes

### 8.1 Gold Standard Validation Status

Folio 88r is the **most important validation folio** in the ZFD framework because:
1. Two label readings ("ostol" and "otrorhetri") have been independently confirmed by Curio
2. These confirmations validate the core ZFD decoding mechanisms: gallows expansion (t-gallows = /tr/), operator prefixes (o- = topic marker), and suffix abbreviations
3. The spatial correlation between labels and illustrations provides semantic confirmation beyond purely textual analysis
4. The folio demonstrates both careful (label) and standard (body text) registers, allowing cross-register glyph comparison

### 8.2 Label Transcription Priority

Labels on f88r should be transcribed before body text because:
- Labels have the highest validation potential (spatial correlation with known illustration types)
- Labels are in careful register (highest glyph clarity)
- Labels are short (1-3 words), reducing transcription error accumulation
- Two labels already have external validation, providing anchor points

### 8.3 Illustration-Text Correlation Protocol

When transcribing f88r labels:
1. Record the spatial position of each label relative to its associated illustration
2. Note which illustration type (vessel, root, plant) the label is adjacent to
3. After decoding, check whether the decoded meaning is semantically compatible with the illustration type
4. Flag any spatial-semantic mismatches for review

### 8.4 Body Text Context

The body text blocks on f88r likely contain pharmaceutical recipe instructions. Expected vocabulary includes:
- Vessel/container terms (ost-, otr- stems)
- Processing instructions (ch- operator for "cook/combine")
- Ingredient references (substance nouns with -aiin suffix)
- Dosage/preparation instructions (da- operator for "give/dose")
- Comitative constructions (sh- operator for "with/soak")

### 8.5 Cross-Folio Comparison

f88r should be compared with:
- **f99r** (similar pharmaceutical layout with vessels and roots)
- **f87r** (pharmaceutical/herbal with plant illustration)
- **f1r** (baseline character form reference)

The pharmaceutical section folios share layout conventions that enable systematic comparison of label forms and vocabulary.
