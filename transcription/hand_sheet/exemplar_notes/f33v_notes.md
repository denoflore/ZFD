## 2. Layout Description (Visual Analysis)

### 2.1 Page Structure

Folio 33v is a **complex herbal folio** with a large, elaborate botanical illustration and dense two-column text. This folio exemplifies the mid-manuscript herbal section, where illustration complexity and text density reach a mature balance.

**Layout zones:**

| Zone | Content | Position |
|------|---------|----------|
| Left | Two columns of text | Left third of page |
| Center/right | Large complex plant illustration | Dominating center and right |
| Top | Labels scattered near plant structures | Upper portion, among illustration elements |
| Bottom | Round cross-section diagrams | Below main plant illustration |
| Near plant | Labels near plant parts | Scattered among illustration elements |

### 2.2 Plant Illustration (Primary)

The dominant illustration is a large, elaborate botanical rendering occupying the center and right of the page:

- **Leaves:** Spiky star-shaped green leaves arranged in rosette formations at multiple levels along the stem. The rosette leaf pattern is distinctive and visually striking.
- **Fruiting bodies:** Two large caterpillar-like or heavily scaled flower/fruit structures at the top of the plant. These are elongated, densely textured, and visually prominent. They may represent seed pods, cones, or inflorescences.
- **Stem:** Central stem connecting the rosette leaves to the fruiting bodies above and root system below.
- **Scale:** The plant extends the full height of the page, making this one of the more elaborate botanical illustrations in the herbal section.

### 2.3 Root Cross-Section Diagrams

At the bottom of the page, below the main plant:
- **Round cross-section diagrams:** Circular forms that appear to depict cross-sections of the root or stem. These show internal structure with concentric or radial patterns.
- **Purpose:** These cross-sections are unusual in the herbal section and suggest the scribe/illustrator intended to convey internal anatomy of the plant, not just external appearance.
- **Labels:** May have associated labels identifying the cross-sectional features.

### 2.4 Text Distribution

Text appears in **two columns on the left side** of the page:

- **Column 1 (far left):** Several lines of text, constrained on the right by the plant illustration.
- **Column 2 (inner left):** Additional text lines between the far-left column and the illustration, possibly a continuation or a separate text block.
- The two-column arrangement allows the scribe to fit substantial text alongside the large illustration.
- Lines in both columns vary in length according to the illustration's profile.

### 2.5 Labels

Labels are distributed throughout the illustration area:
- **Near fruiting bodies:** Labels at the top of the page, adjacent to the scaled fruiting structures
- **Near rosette leaves:** Labels beside the spiky leaf formations
- **Near cross-sections:** Labels associated with the root cross-section diagrams at the bottom
- Labels are short (1-2 words) and written in careful register
- The scatter distribution of labels across the illustration is denser than on simpler herbal pages

## 3. Writing Characteristics Observed

### 3.1 General Hand Quality

The writing on f33v is in **standard register** for the body text, with labels in careful register. This dual-register pattern is consistent across the manuscript but particularly evident on complex illustration pages where labels must be precise identifiers.

### 3.2 Two-Column Text Management

A notable feature of f33v is the **two-column text arrangement**:
- The scribe manages two parallel text columns alongside a large illustration
- Column widths vary with the illustration's profile
- Baseline consistency is maintained within each column
- The column arrangement is relatively uncommon in the herbal section (most pages use a single text block wrapping around the illustration)
- This layout indicates the scribe's adaptability in organizing text within constrained spaces

### 3.3 Baseline and Line Management

- **Baseline:** Consistent within each column. No significant drift across lines.
- **x-height:** Standard 2-3mm, consistent with mid-manuscript herbal folios.
- **Line spacing:** Regular at approximately 6-8mm baseline-to-baseline within each column.
- **Left margin:** Well-defined for the outer column. Inner column margin defined by outer column boundary and illustration edge.
- **Right margin:** Determined by the plant illustration's profile, varying by line.

### 3.4 Word Spacing

Standard spacing in body text. Word boundaries are clear. In the narrower column sections where space is tight, the scribe may slightly compress word spacing, but boundaries remain unambiguous. Label spacing is generous.

### 3.5 Ink and Pen

- Body text in standard brown/sepia iron gall ink
- Pen nib consistent with the manuscript standard
- No visible ink batch changes
- Green pigment in the plant illustration is consistent with the herbal section palette

## 4. Glyph Observations Specific to This Folio

### 4.1 Standard-Register Vowels

At the standard register observed in f33v body text:

- **EVA 'o':** Near-circular, fully closed. Consistent with other herbal folios at standard speed.
- **EVA 'a':** Flowing circle-plus-tail. Clear differentiation from 'o'.
- **EVA 'e':** Stable crescent form, consistent across the folio.
- **EVA 'i':** Clear individual strokes. Distinguishable in 'aiin' sequences.
- **EVA 'y':** Full descender with leftward curve. Standard length.

### 4.2 Standard-Register Consonants

- **EVA 'r':** Hook clearly formed at standard speed.
- **EVA 'n':** Final-position minims well-spaced.
- **EVA 'l':** Height distinction from 'i' maintained.
- **EVA 'd':** Full loop-plus-ascender construction.

### 4.3 Gallows Characters

- **EVA 'k' (k-gallows):** Well-formed loop, standard height. Clear k/t distinction at standard speed.
- **EVA 't' (t-gallows):** Angular loop clearly distinguishable.
- **EVA 'f' (f-gallows):** Full construction with standard fluency.
- **EVA 'p' (p-gallows):** Present but less frequent.

### 4.4 Operator Characters

- **EVA 'ch':** Flowing two-part unit, smooth transition.
- **EVA 'sh':** Three-component fluid sequence.
- **EVA 'qo':** Fluid unit with distinguishable components.

### 4.5 Label Glyphs in Dense Distribution

Labels on f33v are more densely distributed than on simpler herbal pages:
- Label glyph forms are consistent with the careful register seen elsewhere
- The scribe maintains careful construction even when labels are positioned in tight spaces among illustration elements
- Labels near the spiky rosette leaves and fruiting bodies are particularly important for botanical identification
- Label-to-body-text glyph comparison confirms consistent hand

### 4.6 Column-Edge Characters

Characters at the edges of columns where text meets the illustration boundary:
- Occasional slight compression at line ends as the scribe approaches the illustration
- These edge effects are minor and do not significantly affect legibility
- Should be flagged during transcription for potential reading uncertainty

## 5. Speed / Ductus Notes

### 5.1 Speed Register

**Standard register for body text, careful register for labels.**

Evidence for standard register in body text:
- Fluent writing with consistent character proportions
- Standard ligature execution
- Gallows constructed with practiced fluency
- Word spacing clear and consistent
- No compression beyond normal line-end adjustments

Evidence for careful register in labels:
- More deliberate character construction
- Generous spacing between label words
- Gallows loops more precisely drawn
- Labels maintain clarity despite small positioning constraints

### 5.2 Ductus Observations

At standard speed in f33v body text:
- **'aiin' ligature:** Continuous pen movement, produced as a practiced unit.
- **Gallows:** Moderate fluency. Well-formed but not as deliberate as f1r.
- **'ch'/'sh':** Fluid pen movements, standard-register execution.
- **Column transitions:** The scribe may lift the pen longer between columns, but within each column the ductus is continuous and rhythmic.

### 5.3 Mid-Manuscript Character

As a mid-manuscript folio, f33v allows assessment of the scribe's hand at the midpoint of the writing process:
- Character forms are fully mature and consistent
- No evidence of fatigue, deterioration, or style drift from earlier folios
- The scribe's hand at folio 33 is indistinguishable in quality from the early folios (f3r)
- This consistency supports a single-scribe attribution for at least the herbal section

## 6. Abbreviation Marks Observed

### 6.1 Gallows Abbreviations

Standard gallows abbreviation patterns present:
- **k-gallows** (/-st-/ or /-sk-/): Present in medial position
- **t-gallows** (/-tr-/ or /-tv-/): Present, consistent with herbal vocabulary
- **f-gallows** (/-pr-/ or /-fr-/): Present but less frequent
- **p-gallows** (/-pl-/ or /-sp-/): Present but least frequent

### 6.2 Operator Prefixes

Herbal text operators observed:
- **ch-** (action/directional): Frequent in body text
- **sh-** (comitative/with): Present
- **qo-** (quantity/relative): Present
- **o-** (topic marker): Expected in labels and identification terms
- **d-** (dative/directional): Present

### 6.3 Suffix Abbreviations

Standard suffix inventory:
- **-y** (adjective): Frequent throughout
- **-aiin** (substance noun): Present
- **-ar** (water/agent): Present
- **-or** (oil marker): Present
- **-n**, **-l**, **-r**: Standard endings

### 6.4 Complex Plant Vocabulary

The elaborate illustration on f33v (rosette leaves, scaled fruiting bodies, root cross-sections) suggests specialized botanical vocabulary:
- Labels near the fruiting bodies may contain terms not found on simpler herbal pages
- The root cross-section diagrams may have associated anatomical terminology
- Abbreviation patterns in these specialized labels should be compared with pharmaceutical terminology for potential overlap (pharmaceutical terms also describe processed plant materials)

## 7. Key EVA Lines for Reference

### 7.1 Two-Column Text

Specific EVA lines for f33v should be extracted from the Takahashi transcription. Key characteristics:

- Two columns must be transcribed separately, noting which column each line belongs to
- Column boundaries may not align perfectly line-by-line (each column may have different numbers of lines)
- The relationship between the two columns (parallel description, continuation, or independent entries) should be determined from content

### 7.2 Label Inventory

Labels on f33v should be comprehensively inventoried:
- **Fruiting body labels:** Near the large scaled structures at the top
- **Rosette leaf labels:** Near the spiky leaf formations at various levels
- **Cross-section labels:** Near the round diagrams at the bottom
- Each label should be recorded with its spatial position and the illustration element it identifies

### 7.3 Expected Vocabulary

Based on the herbal section context and the complex illustration:
- Plant identification terms
- Specialized botanical descriptors for unusual structures (spiky rosettes, scaled fruiting bodies)
- Possible anatomical terms for the cross-section diagrams
- Descriptive adjectives (-y suffix) for plant properties
- Preparation or usage vocabulary in the body text

## 8. Transcription-Relevant Notes

### 8.1 Mid-Manuscript Herbal Exemplar

Folio 33v is valuable as a **mid-manuscript herbal exemplar**:
- Demonstrates the mature herbal section layout with complex illustration
- Provides comparison point between early (f3r) and late (f56r) herbal folios
- Confirms scribal consistency across the first third of the manuscript
- The two-column text arrangement adds layout diversity to the exemplar set

### 8.2 Complex Illustration Analysis

The elaborate plant illustration on f33v warrants special transcription attention:
- The spiky rosette leaves are distinctive and may narrow botanical identification candidates
- The large scaled fruiting bodies are visually unusual and may represent identifiable structures (cones, catkins, or inflorescences)
- The root cross-section diagrams are rare in the herbal section and may indicate a plant whose internal structure was considered important
- Decoded labels near these features should be compared with botanical references for validation

### 8.3 Two-Column Layout Protocol

When transcribing f33v:
1. Identify the boundary between the two text columns
2. Transcribe each column separately, numbering lines within each column
3. Note where column widths are constrained by the illustration
4. Determine whether the two columns are sequential (column 1 then column 2) or parallel (same topic from different angles)
5. Flag any text that appears to span both columns or connect between them

### 8.4 Cross-Section Diagram Labels

The root cross-section diagrams are transcription-critical:
- Labels associated with these diagrams may contain terms for internal plant anatomy
- These terms might differ from the surface-description vocabulary used in labels near leaves and flowers
- The cross-section convention is unusual enough to warrant special notation in the transcription
- Compare with any similar cross-section diagrams elsewhere in the manuscript

### 8.5 Dense Label Distribution

The dense distribution of labels across the illustration makes f33v a good exemplar for:
- Label-identification methodology (how to associate each label with its referent illustration element)
- Spatial mapping of label positions relative to illustration features
- Testing the consistency of label writing conventions (register, spacing, glyph forms) across different positions on the same page
