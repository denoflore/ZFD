## 2. Layout Description (Visual Analysis)

### 2.1 Page Structure

Folio 13v is a **two-plant herbal folio** -- one of the pages in the herbal section that presents two botanical illustrations side by side rather than a single dominant plant. This layout variant provides a useful comparison with the more common single-plant pages.

**Layout zones:**

| Zone | Content | Position |
|------|---------|----------|
| Upper | Text block (above illustrations) | Top portion of page |
| Left center | Plant illustration 1 | Left-center area |
| Right center | Plant illustration 2 (with blue flowers) | Right-center area |
| Lower | Text block (below illustrations) | Bottom portion of page |
| Near plants | Labels near plant parts | Adjacent to illustrations |

### 2.2 Plant Illustration 1 (Left)

The left plant illustration features:
- **Leaves:** Thick layered/scaled green-brown leaves with a dense, overlapping structure
- **Root:** Small root structure visible at the base
- **Scale:** Approximately half the page width, sharing space with the second plant
- **Style:** The layered leaf texture suggests a succulent-like or scaled leaf structure

### 2.3 Plant Illustration 2 (Right)

The right plant illustration features:
- **Leaves:** Similar thick layered/scaled green-brown leaves
- **Flowers:** Distinctive blue flowers atop the leaf mass -- the blue pigment is notable and may indicate a specific botanical identification
- **Root:** Small root structure at the base
- **Scale:** Approximately half the page width, mirroring the left plant in size
- **Style:** The blue flowers distinguish this plant from its neighbor despite similar leaf structures

### 2.4 Text Distribution

Text appears in **two main blocks** framing the illustrations:

- **Upper text block:** Several lines of text above the two plant illustrations. Lines span the full page width, unconstrained by illustrations.
- **Lower text block:** Several lines of text below the plant illustrations. Similarly spanning the full width.

This top-and-bottom text arrangement differs from the left-side wrapping text seen on single-plant pages (e.g., f3r), making f13v useful for observing how the scribe manages different layout configurations.

### 2.5 Labels

Labels appear near specific plant parts:
- Short identifying terms (1-2 words)
- Positioned adjacent to leaves, flowers, or roots
- Likely identifying the plants or their parts
- The labels near the blue-flowered plant are of particular interest for botanical cross-identification

## 3. Writing Characteristics Observed

### 3.1 General Hand Quality

The writing on f13v is in **standard register** throughout the body text, consistent with the herbal section's normal working pace. Labels show the expected slightly more careful construction.

### 3.2 Full-Width Text Lines

A distinctive feature of f13v is that the text blocks above and below the illustrations span the **full page width**:
- Lines are longer than on single-plant pages where text wraps around the illustration
- The scribe maintains baseline consistency across these longer lines
- Word spacing remains standard and unambiguous
- The longer lines provide more text per line, which is useful for statistical analysis

### 3.3 Baseline and Line Management

- **Baseline:** Consistent within each text block. No significant drift even across the longer full-width lines.
- **x-height:** Standard 2-3mm, consistent with other herbal folios.
- **Line spacing:** Regular at approximately 6-8mm baseline-to-baseline.
- **Left margin:** Well-defined and consistent between the upper and lower text blocks.
- **Right margin:** Ragged right, consistent with herbal section conventions.

### 3.4 Word Spacing

Standard spacing throughout. Word boundaries are clear and unambiguous. The full-width lines show no compression at line ends, suggesting the scribe had ample space and maintained comfortable spacing.

### 3.5 Ink and Pen

- Body text in standard brown/sepia iron gall ink
- Pen nib consistent with the manuscript standard
- No visible ink batch changes
- Blue pigment in the flower illustrations is distinct from the text ink and other plant pigments

## 4. Glyph Observations Specific to This Folio

### 4.1 Standard-Register Vowels

At the standard register observed in f13v:

- **EVA 'o':** Near-circular, fully closed. Consistent quality with other herbal folios.
- **EVA 'a':** Flowing circle-plus-tail. Clearly differentiated from 'o'.
- **EVA 'e':** Stable crescent form. Consistent across the folio.
- **EVA 'i':** Clear individual strokes. Distinguishable within 'aiin' sequences.
- **EVA 'y':** Full descender with leftward curve. Standard length for the herbal section.

### 4.2 Standard-Register Consonants

- **EVA 'r':** Hook clearly formed at standard speed.
- **EVA 'n':** Final-position minims well-spaced. Word boundaries clear.
- **EVA 'l':** Height distinction from 'i' maintained.
- **EVA 'd':** Full loop-plus-ascender construction. Open baseline loop.

### 4.3 Gallows Characters

- **EVA 'k' (k-gallows):** Well-formed loop. Standard height (~2.5x x-height).
- **EVA 't' (t-gallows):** Angular loop clearly distinguishable from k at standard speed.
- **EVA 'f' (f-gallows):** Full construction, rendered with standard fluency.
- **EVA 'p' (p-gallows):** Distinctive loop orientation, less frequent.

### 4.4 Operator Characters

- **EVA 'ch':** Flowing two-part unit. Crescent-to-h transition smooth.
- **EVA 'sh':** Three-component fluid sequence.
- **EVA 'qo':** Fluid unit with distinguishable q-descender and o-circle.

### 4.5 Two-Plant Page Glyph Comparison

The two text blocks (above and below the illustrations) may describe different plants:
- Comparing glyph forms between the upper and lower blocks can confirm the scribe's consistency within a single folio
- Any vocabulary differences between the blocks likely reflect different plant identifications rather than scribal variation
- Label glyphs near each plant should be compared for mutual consistency

---

## 5. Speed / Ductus Notes

### 5.1 Speed Register

**Standard register throughout.** Consistent between upper and lower text blocks.

Evidence for standard register:
- Fluent, rhythmic writing with consistent proportions
- Standard ligature execution (ch, sh, aiin as connected units)
- Gallows constructed with practiced fluency
- Word spacing clear and consistent
- Full descender extension on 'y'

### 5.2 Ductus Observations

At standard speed in f13v:
- **'aiin' ligature:** Continuous pen movement well-established. The ligature is produced as a practiced unit.
- **Gallows:** Moderate fluency in construction. Well-formed but not as deliberate as f1r careful register.
- **'ch'/'sh':** Fluid pen movements, consistent with standard-register execution elsewhere.
- **Line-initial characters:** The first character of each line shows no evidence of hesitation or special treatment.

### 5.3 Full-Width Line Rhythm

The full-width text lines in f13v allow observation of the scribe's sustained writing rhythm:
- The scribe maintains consistent speed across longer lines
- No evidence of deceleration toward line ends
- The rhythm is even, suggesting copying from a model or composing from internalized knowledge
- Line breaks occur at word boundaries (no mid-word breaks observed)

## 6. Abbreviation Marks Observed

### 6.1 Gallows Abbreviations

Standard gallows abbreviation patterns present:
- **k-gallows** (/-st-/ or /-sk-/): Present in medial position
- **t-gallows** (/-tr-/ or /-tv-/): Present, consistent with herbal vocabulary
- **f-gallows** (/-pr-/ or /-fr-/): Present but less frequent
- **p-gallows** (/-pl-/ or /-sp-/): Present but least frequent

### 6.2 Operator Prefixes

Herbal text operators observed:
- **ch-** (action/directional): Frequent in body text
- **sh-** (comitative/with): Present, likely for preparation contexts
- **qo-** (quantity/relative): Present
- **o-** (topic marker): Expected for botanical identification
- **d-** (dative/directional): Present

### 6.3 Suffix Abbreviations

Standard suffix inventory:
- **-y** (adjective): Frequent throughout
- **-aiin** (substance noun): Present, marking botanical/substance terms
- **-ar** (water/agent): Present
- **-or** (oil marker): Present
- **-n**, **-l**, **-r**: Standard endings

### 6.4 Two-Plant Vocabulary Comparison

The upper and lower text blocks may contain different abbreviation patterns if they describe different plants:
- Comparing operator frequency between blocks can reveal whether description conventions vary by plant type
- Suffix distribution may differ if the plants have different uses (medicinal vs. culinary, for example)
- This within-folio comparison eliminates scribal variation as a confound

## 7. Key EVA Lines for Reference

### 7.1 Upper Text Block

The upper text block spans the full page width and likely introduces or describes the first plant (or both plants). Specific EVA lines should be extracted from the Takahashi transcription file.

Key characteristics:
- Full-width lines provide longer token sequences
- Paragraph structure (if present) should be noted
- Initial words may include botanical identification terms

### 7.2 Lower Text Block

The lower text block, also full-width, likely provides additional description, preparation instructions, or the second plant's entry.

Key characteristics:
- Compare vocabulary with upper block for plant-specific differences
- Note any recipe-like operator sequences (ch-, sh-, da-)

### 7.3 Label Content

Labels near the two plants should be extracted individually:
- Identify which plant each label is associated with
- The label near the blue-flowered plant is of particular interest for identification
- Cross-reference with other herbal folio labels for vocabulary overlap

### 7.4 Expected Vocabulary

Based on the herbal section context and two-plant layout:
- Two distinct plant identification terms (one per plant)
- Descriptive terminology for leaves, flowers, roots
- The blue flower pigment suggests the plant may be identifiable, making the label a candidate for botanical validation

## 8. Transcription-Relevant Notes

### 8.1 Two-Plant Layout Variant

Folio 13v demonstrates the **two-plant layout variant** within the herbal section:
- Two plants share the central illustration space
- Text is arranged above and below rather than wrapping around
- This layout occurs on several herbal folios and represents a systematic page-design choice
- The scribe allocates roughly equal space to each plant, suggesting both are of comparable importance

### 8.2 Blue Flower Botanical Identification

The distinctive blue flowers on the right plant are a potential identification marker:
- Blue pigment is used sparingly in the manuscript, making this illustration notable
- If the plant can be independently identified as a blue-flowered species, the associated label provides a validation opportunity
- The rose recipe context suggested by manuscript scholars makes rosa species or related plants a candidate, though the blue flowers may indicate a different identification
- Cross-reference with botanical analyses of the manuscript's herbal illustrations

### 8.3 Layered Leaf Structure

Both plants on f13v display thick, layered/scaled leaf structures:
- This rendering style may represent a specific leaf type (succulent, scaled, or densely layered petals)
- The shared leaf style between the two plants may indicate related species or similar plant families
- Compare with other herbal folios showing layered leaf structures to build a leaf-type taxonomy

### 8.4 Text Block Segmentation

The two-block text layout raises questions about content organization:
- Does the upper block describe plant 1 and the lower block describe plant 2?
- Or does the upper block describe both plants and the lower block provide usage/recipe information?
- Decoded text content should clarify the organizational structure
- Compare with other two-plant folios to identify the convention

### 8.5 Full-Width Line Statistical Value

The full-width text lines on f13v are valuable for:
- Longer uninterrupted token sequences (more statistical data per line)
- Word-transition (bigram) analysis with larger sample sizes
- Character frequency statistics from sustained writing without illustration interruption
- Comparison with illustration-constrained lines on single-plant pages to test whether line length affects vocabulary or abbreviation patterns
