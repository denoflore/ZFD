## 2. Layout Description (Visual Analysis)

### 2.1 Page Structure (Two-Page Spread)

Folio 67r is part of a **two-page cosmological spread** (f67r and f67v visible together). This spread contains two large circular diagrams, one on each page, along with associated text blocks.

**Left page (f67r):**

| Zone | Content | Position |
|------|---------|----------|
| Center | Large circular sun-face diagram | Dominating the page |
| Perimeter | Text labels in concentric rings and around edges | Around the diagram |
| Top | Short text block | Above the circular diagram |
| Between diagrams | Possible connecting text | Right edge, near f67v |

**Right page (f67v):**

| Zone | Content | Position |
|------|---------|----------|
| Center | Circular diagram with celestial objects | Dominating the page |
| Perimeter | Text labels in concentric rings | Around the diagram |
| Bottom | Text block | Below the circular diagram |

### 2.2 Sun-Face Diagram (f67r, Left Page)

The primary illustration on f67r is a **large circular diagram with a sun face at its center**:

- **Center:** A face (sun personification) with clearly drawn features
- **Rays:** Alternating blue and red pointed rays radiating outward from the central face. These rays create a mandala-like pattern.
- **Concentric rings:** Multiple concentric rings surround the central face, with text labels written along these curved paths
- **Outer perimeter:** Additional text labels distributed around the outermost ring

This diagram is one of the most visually striking pages in the manuscript and represents cosmological or astronomical content.

### 2.3 Celestial Object Diagram (f67v, Right Page)

The circular diagram on f67v contains:
- **Concentric rings:** Multiple rings containing what appear to be moon phases or other celestial objects
- **Labels:** Text written in curved paths around and between the rings
- **Overall design:** Complementary to the f67r sun diagram, possibly representing lunar or planetary content

### 2.4 Text Distribution

Text on f67r appears in several distinct contexts:

1. **Concentric ring labels:** Written along curved paths following the arcs of the concentric rings. These labels identify elements within the diagram.
2. **Perimeter labels:** Written around the outer edge of the circular diagram.
3. **Top text block:** A short block of standard horizontal text above the diagram.
4. **Inter-diagram text:** Possible text between the two diagrams where the pages meet.

## 3. Writing Characteristics Observed

### 3.1 Dual-Register Writing

Like f88r, this folio displays two speed registers:

- **Labels (careful register, small):** Written along curved paths within and around the diagrams. These are notably small -- the x-height is reduced compared to body text, but the letterforms remain carefully constructed. The scribe adapts to the restricted space of the concentric rings while maintaining legibility.

- **Body text (standard register):** The text block at the top of the page is written in standard horizontal lines at normal body-text scale. Writing characteristics are consistent with standard-register text elsewhere in the manuscript.

### 3.2 Curved-Path Writing

The most distinctive paleographic feature of f67r is the **adaptation of the script to curved writing paths**:

- Labels follow the arcs of the concentric rings, curving with the geometry of the diagram
- The scribe rotates individual letterforms to align with the local tangent of the curve
- Character proportions are maintained despite the curved path
- Word spacing along curves is slightly wider than in horizontal text (to compensate for the angular separation between characters)
- The baseline is defined by the arc of the ring rather than a horizontal line

This curved-path writing demonstrates the scribe's ability to maintain consistent letterforms under non-standard layout demands. The fundamental character shapes (o, a, e, i, y, gallows, operators) remain recognizable despite the rotational adaptation.

### 3.3 Scale Reduction in Labels

Labels within the concentric rings are written at a **reduced scale** compared to body text:
- x-height approximately 1.5-2mm (compared to 2-3mm in body text)
- Gallows characters are proportionally reduced but maintain their relative height ratio
- Character spacing is tighter to fit within the ring width
- Despite the reduced scale, the scribe's hand characteristics remain consistent

### 3.4 Baseline Management

- **Curved labels:** The baseline follows the arc of the concentric ring. The scribe maintains consistent character height relative to this curved baseline.
- **Horizontal text:** Standard baseline management consistent with other folios.
- **Transition:** The scribe transitions smoothly between curved-path and horizontal writing modes.

## 4. Glyph Observations Specific to This Folio

### 4.1 Curved-Path Label Glyphs

In the concentric ring labels:
- **EVA 'o':** Still circular, though at reduced scale the circles are smaller (~1-1.5mm diameter). Closures remain complete.
- **EVA 'a':** Circle-plus-tail maintained. The tail connects to the next character along the curved path.
- **EVA 'e':** Crescent form stable at reduced scale. One of the most reliable characters across all scales and orientations.
- **EVA 'i':** Short vertical strokes oriented perpendicular to the local baseline arc (not absolute vertical). This rotational adaptation is a key observation.
- **EVA 'y':** Descender follows the radial direction (pointing toward or away from the center of the diagram, depending on the ring). This is a distinctive adaptation unique to curved-path writing.

### 4.2 Gallows in Labels

Gallows characters in concentric ring labels:
- Proportionally reduced in height
- Vertical stems oriented perpendicular to the curved baseline (radially, relative to the diagram center)
- Loop geometry maintained at reduced scale, though k/t distinction may be harder to resolve due to size
- Gallows are less frequent in labels than in body text (labels tend to be short identifier words)

### 4.3 Body Text Glyphs

The horizontal text block at the top of f67r shows standard character forms:
- Consistent with f87r standard-register observations
- No special adaptations for the cosmological context
- Standard gallows construction and spacing

### 4.4 Rotational Consistency

A critical observation: despite writing along curved paths, the scribe's **relative character proportions and construction habits remain constant**. The rotation is applied uniformly to the entire character set. This confirms that the script is deeply internalized by the scribe -- the individual letterforms are produced from motor memory regardless of writing orientation.

## 5. Speed / Ductus Notes

### 5.1 Label Speed

**Careful register (small scale).** The labels are small but deliberate:
- Each character is individually formed
- No ligature compression beyond the standard connected units (ch, sh, aiin)
- Word boundaries are maintained despite restricted space
- The careful speed is necessitated by the precision required for curved-path writing

### 5.2 Body Text Speed

**Standard register** in the horizontal text blocks. Consistent with other folios at standard speed.

### 5.3 Ductus Under Rotation

When writing along curved paths:
- The scribe appears to rotate the page (or reposition the hand) to maintain a comfortable writing angle
- Pen strokes follow the same relative directions as in horizontal writing, but rotated to match the curve
- Pen lifts are consistent with standard careful-register behavior
- The ductus is adapted by rotation, not reinvented -- the same motor sequences produce characters at any orientation

## 6. Abbreviation Marks Observed

### 6.1 Gallows in Labels

Gallows abbreviation marks appear in some labels:
- **k-gallows** and **t-gallows** present at reduced scale
- Expansion rules (k = st, t = tr) apply the same in labels as in body text
- Gallows in labels may abbreviate astronomical/cosmological terms

### 6.2 Operator Prefixes in Labels

Label-initial operators:
- **o-** (topic marker): Identifying diagram elements ("this is...")
- **ch-** (action operator): Possible in labels describing functions
- **sh-** (comitative): Less expected in cosmological context but may be present

### 6.3 Suffix Abbreviations

- **-y** (adjective): Present in labels (modifying diagram element names)
- **-aiin** (substance): Less expected in cosmological context; more likely in pharmaceutical
- **-n**, **-l**, **-r**: Standard noun/agent endings in label text

### 6.4 Label Abbreviation Density

Labels in f67r tend to be **shorter and less abbreviation-dense** than pharmaceutical labels. Cosmological labels may represent proper names or descriptive terms rather than recipe instructions, affecting the expected abbreviation patterns.

## 7. Key EVA Lines for Reference

### 7.1 Label Characteristics

Specific EVA transcription of individual labels should be extracted from the Takahashi transcription file. Key considerations:

- Labels are distributed around concentric rings (not sequential lines)
- Reading order follows the ring path (typically clockwise from a starting position)
- Each label may correspond to a specific diagram element (ray, section, celestial object)

### 7.2 Body Text

The horizontal text block at the top of f67r should be transcribed as standard sequential lines, consistent with other folios.

### 7.3 Expected Vocabulary

Based on the cosmological section context:
- Celestial body names or descriptions
- Directional/positional terms
- Color terms (associated with the blue and red rays)
- Possibly calendar or time-related vocabulary
- Vocabulary may differ from the pharmaceutical section

## 8. Transcription-Relevant Notes

### 8.1 Curved-Path Transcription Protocol

When transcribing f67r labels:
1. Identify each concentric ring and number it from center outward
2. Establish a starting position (typically 12 o'clock or a marked starting point)
3. Read labels clockwise (or counterclockwise if the scribe's direction is evident from pen-stroke direction)
4. Note the angular position of each label relative to the diagram
5. Record the spatial relationship between labels and diagram elements (rays, sections, celestial objects)

### 8.2 Scale-Dependent Glyph Ambiguity

At the reduced label scale in f67r, certain glyph distinctions may be harder to resolve:
- **k-gallows vs. t-gallows:** Loop geometry differences are reduced at small scale
- **'i' vs. 'l':** Height distinction narrows
- **'o' vs. 'a':** Circle/circle-with-tail distinction may be marginal at very small scale

Transcription should flag uncertain readings with confidence markers. Cross-reference with the larger body-text glyphs on the same folio to calibrate expectations.

### 8.3 Layout as Content Signal

The cosmological diagram layout provides contextual information:
- Labels near the sun face likely describe the sun or central concept
- Labels in outer rings may describe planets, stars, or peripheral elements
- The alternating blue/red ray pattern may correspond to a classification scheme that labels describe
- The relationship between f67r (sun) and f67v (moon/celestial) diagrams may be thematic (day/night, solar/lunar)

### 8.4 Comparison with Other Diagram Folios

f67r should be compared with:
- Other cosmological/zodiac folios for layout and vocabulary consistency
- f85v-86r (Rosette foldout) for another instance of label-heavy, diagram-oriented writing
- The scribal adaptation to curved paths in f67r may also appear in zodiac folios with circular diagrams

### 8.5 Body-Text vs. Label Vocabulary

The text block at the top of f67r may contain different vocabulary from the labels:
- Body text might provide narrative or explanatory context
- Labels are likely identifier terms
- Comparing vocabulary between body text and labels on the same folio can reveal whether the scribe uses different abbreviation patterns for different text types within the same section
