## 2. Layout Description (Visual Analysis)

### 2.1 Page Structure (Six-Panel Foldout)

The Rosette foldout is the **most complex layout in the entire manuscript**. It is a large six-panel foldout that, when fully opened, displays a composite diagram of nine circular rosette structures arranged in a 3x3 grid.

**Overall structure:**

| Row | Left Rosette | Center Rosette | Right Rosette |
|-----|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Top | Rosette 1 | Rosette 2 | Rosette 3 |
| Middle | Rosette 4 | **Rosette 5 (central, largest)** | Rosette 6 |
| Bottom | Rosette 7 | Rosette 8 | Rosette 9 |

The central rosette (Rosette 5) is the **largest**, occupying the most space and displaying the most elaborate internal structure. The surrounding eight rosettes are smaller but individually detailed.

### 2.2 Rosette Structure

Each rosette consists of:
- **Concentric rings:** Multiple concentric circular bands radiating outward from a central point or feature. Each ring may contain text labels, decorative elements, or symbolic markers.
- **Central feature:** Each rosette has a distinctive center -- some with small illustrations (buildings, castles, or geographic features), others with decorative motifs or text.
- **Colored elements:** Blue, gold/tan, and green pigments appear within various rosettes, distinguishing regions or elements within the diagrams.
- **Text labels:** Written along the concentric rings, within ring sections, and around the outer perimeters of each rosette.

### 2.3 Connecting Pathways

Between the nine rosettes:
- **Channels or pathways:** Connecting lines, tubes, or pathways link the rosettes to each other, suggesting a network or system relationship.
- **Labels along pathways:** Some connecting pathways have associated text labels.
- **Network structure:** The nine rosettes form an interconnected system rather than nine independent diagrams. The connecting pathways may represent roads, waterways, trade routes, or conceptual relationships.

### 2.4 Text Distribution

Text on the Rosette foldout appears in several distinct contexts:

1. **Concentric ring labels:** Written along curved paths within the rings of each rosette. These are the most numerous labels and the smallest in scale.
2. **Central labels:** Text within or near the central feature of each rosette.
3. **Perimeter labels:** Text around the outer edge of each rosette.
4. **Pathway labels:** Text along the connecting channels between rosettes.
5. **Marginal text:** Any text in the margins outside the rosette system.

### 2.5 Scale and Density

The label density on this foldout is **the highest in the manuscript**:
- Nine rosettes, each with multiple concentric rings of text
- Dozens to possibly hundreds of individual labels
- The writing is at the smallest scale found anywhere in the manuscript
- The foldout format means the total text area, when opened, is six times a standard page

## 3. Writing Characteristics Observed

### 3.1 Dual-Register Writing (Extreme Scale Reduction)

The Rosette foldout displays the most extreme form of the dual-register pattern:

- **Labels (careful register, extremely small):** Written at approximately 1-1.5mm x-height -- roughly half the normal label scale seen on single-page diagrams. Despite this extreme reduction, the scribe maintains proportional consistency within the character set. Individual letterforms are recognizable, though at the limit of legibility.

- **Body text / longer passages:** Where longer text passages appear (margins or larger blank areas), the writing approaches standard register at a more normal scale. These passages provide calibration reference for the label content.

### 3.2 Curved-Path Writing (Multi-Rosette)

The scribe writes along curved paths within each rosette's concentric rings:
- The curved-path writing technique observed in f67r is applied across all nine rosettes
- The scribe must maintain consistent letterforms while writing at very small scale along varying radii of curvature
- Tighter inner rings have sharper curvature, requiring greater adaptation
- Outer rings have gentler curvature, approaching near-linear text
- The scribe's ability to maintain legible script at this combined challenge (small scale + curved path) is remarkable

### 3.3 Baseline Management

- **Ring labels:** The baseline follows the arc of each concentric ring. Character height is consistent relative to the ring width.
- **Central labels:** May be horizontal or oriented to the rosette's geometry.
- **Pathway labels:** Follow the direction of the connecting pathway -- which may be straight, curved, or angled.
- **Marginal text:** Standard horizontal baselines.

### 3.4 Word Spacing

At the extremely small label scale:
- Word spacing is proportionally maintained but physically very narrow (sub-millimeter gaps)
- Word boundaries may be difficult to resolve at this scale without high-resolution imaging
- Digital magnification is essential for confident word-boundary identification
- The scribe appears to maintain the same proportional word-to-character-spacing ratio seen at normal scale

### 3.5 Ink and Pen

- Labels written with what appears to be the same pen used for body text, but with extremely controlled, fine strokes
- The pen nib may have been sharpened or a finer point selected for the smallest labels
- Ink consistency is good -- the small text is not significantly fainter than normal-scale text
- The professional quality of the extremely small writing indicates specialized scribal skill

## 4. Glyph Observations Specific to This Folio

### 4.1 Extremely Small-Scale Vowels

At the ~1-1.5mm x-height:

- **EVA 'o':** Reduced to very small circles (~0.5-1mm diameter). At this scale, fully closed circles are technically difficult. Some 'o' forms may show incomplete closure, approaching 'a'-like forms.
- **EVA 'a':** Circle-plus-tail maintained but at minimum expression. The tail is very short, and the circle portion may be abbreviated.
- **EVA 'e':** Crescent form remains identifiable at small scale. As with f67r, 'e' is one of the most reliable characters across scales.
- **EVA 'i':** Very short vertical strokes. In minim sequences (ii, iii), individual strokes may be barely distinguishable.
- **EVA 'y':** Descender present but very short. At the smallest scale, the distinction between 'y' and 'i' narrows to a minimal below-baseline extension.

### 4.2 Extremely Small-Scale Gallows

Gallows at ~1-1.5mm x-height:
- **Height:** Proportionally reduced. Gallows may stand approximately 2-3mm tall at this scale (compared to 5-8mm at normal scale).
- **Loop geometry:** k/t distinction is at its most challenging. The loop forms are reduced to minimal gestures.
- **f-gallows and p-gallows:** More elaborate constructions may be simplified at this extreme scale.
- **Identification strategy:** Context-based disambiguation becomes critical. Statistical expectations and known vocabulary should supplement visual identification.

### 4.3 Operator Characters at Small Scale

- **EVA 'ch':** Written as a single minimal gesture. The two-component structure may be barely resoluble.
- **EVA 'sh':** Compressed to a very small form. The three-component structure may appear as a two-component gesture.
- **EVA 'qo':** At minimum scale, the q-descender and o-circle merge into a tiny compound form.

### 4.4 Label-Specific Observations

Labels across the nine rosettes should be analyzed for:
- Consistency of glyph forms across all nine rosettes (was the same person writing all labels, or were different rosettes labeled at different times?)
- Variation in glyph quality by position (are central rosette labels better formed than peripheral ones?)
- Scale variation between inner and outer ring labels (inner rings are more constrained)
- Consistency with labels on other diagram folios (f67r, pharmaceutical labels on f88r)

## 5. Speed / Ductus Notes

### 5.1 Speed Register

**Careful but small register.** The labels are deliberate despite their tiny scale:
- Each character is individually formed (no speed-induced ligature shortcuts beyond standard units)
- The careful speed is necessitated by the extreme precision required
- Writing at this scale demands physical control that precludes rapid execution
- The scribe must have used extreme pen control and possibly visual aids

### 5.2 Ductus Under Extreme Scale Reduction

At ~1-1.5mm x-height:
- Pen movements are reduced to miniature versions of the standard ductus
- The same relative stroke directions are maintained
- Pen lifts between characters are very short (minimal hand movement)
- The motor pattern is consistent with standard-scale writing, only scaled down
- This confirms the deeply internalized nature of the script -- the scribe's motor memory produces consistent letterforms regardless of scale

### 5.3 Multi-Session Writing

The enormous scale of the Rosette foldout (six panels, nine rosettes, hundreds of labels) means the scribe almost certainly wrote this over **multiple sessions**:
- Look for consistency markers between sessions (ink color variation, scale drift, style changes)
- Rosette boundaries may correspond to session breaks
- The connecting pathways may have been labeled at a different time than the rosettes themselves
- Despite potential multi-session execution, the overall quality remains remarkably consistent

### 5.4 Physical Writing Conditions

The foldout format creates unique physical writing challenges:
- The scribe must manage a large, unwieldy surface
- Writing in the center of the foldout requires reaching across panels
- Ink smearing risk is elevated due to the hand resting on already-inscribed areas
- The consistent quality despite these challenges further demonstrates professional skill

## 6. Abbreviation Marks Observed

### 6.1 Gallows in Labels

Gallows abbreviation marks appear in rosette labels:
- **k-gallows** and **t-gallows** present at extremely reduced scale
- Expansion rules apply identically at small scale
- The frequency of gallows in rosette labels should be compared with their frequency in body text and pharmaceutical labels

### 6.2 Operator Prefixes in Labels

Label-initial operators in rosette labels:
- **o-** (topic marker): Identifying diagram elements, likely the most frequent operator in this context
- **ch-** (action operator): Possible in labels describing processes or functions
- **sh-** (comitative): Less expected in geographic/cosmological context but may be present
- **d-** (dative/directional): Possible for directional or locative labels

### 6.3 Suffix Abbreviations

- **-y** (adjective): Present in labels modifying rosette element names
- **-aiin** (substance): Less expected in cosmological/geographic context
- **-n**, **-l**, **-r**: Standard endings in label text
- **-ar** (water/agent): May be present if rosettes represent geographic features with water associations

### 6.4 Label Abbreviation Patterns

Rosette labels may have distinctive abbreviation characteristics:
- Labels likely represent **place names, feature names, or categorical terms** rather than recipe instructions
- The abbreviation system may express geographic or cosmological vocabulary differently from pharmaceutical vocabulary
- Comparing abbreviation patterns across the nine rosettes can reveal whether different rosettes describe different categories of content
- Pathway labels may use directional operators more frequently than ring labels

## 7. Key EVA Lines for Reference

### 7.1 Label Inventory (Per Rosette)

Labels should be inventoried systematically, rosette by rosette:

1. **For each rosette (1-9):**
   - Number the concentric rings from center outward
   - Read labels along each ring (establish reading direction from pen-stroke evidence)
   - Record the angular position of each label within its ring
   - Note the central feature and any associated labels
   - Record perimeter labels

2. **For connecting pathways:**
   - Identify each pathway by its source and destination rosettes
   - Record pathway labels in sequence along the pathway
   - Note the direction of the pathway (if determinable)

### 7.2 Central Rosette (Rosette 5)

The central rosette is the largest and most elaborate:
- Its labels may be written at a slightly larger scale than peripheral rosettes
- The central feature likely represents the most important element in the diagram system
- Priority should be given to transcribing the central rosette labels first

### 7.3 Expected Vocabulary

Based on the cosmological/geographic context:
- Place names or geographic feature names
- Directional terms (north, south, east, west or equivalents)
- Categorical descriptors (city, mountain, river, or equivalents)
- Possibly calendrical or astrological terms
- Vocabulary may differ significantly from herbal and pharmaceutical sections

## 8. Transcription-Relevant Notes

### 8.1 Most Complex Transcription Task

The Rosette foldout is the **most complex transcription challenge** in the manuscript:
- Hundreds of individual labels at extremely small scale
- Nine separate rosette structures, each with multiple concentric rings
- Curved-path writing at minimum scale
- Connecting pathway labels at various orientations
- The foldout format complicates scanning and image alignment

### 8.2 High-Resolution Imaging Requirements

Transcription of the Rosette foldout requires:
- Maximum available resolution from the IIIF image service
- Digital magnification at 400-800% or higher for the smallest labels
- Color-enhanced imaging to distinguish blue, gold, and green elements within rosettes
- Panel-by-panel processing to manage the large image size
- Image stitching or alignment if the foldout is captured in multiple panels

### 8.3 Systematic Rosette-by-Rosette Protocol

Transcription should proceed systematically:
1. Begin with the central rosette (Rosette 5) -- largest labels, best legibility
2. Proceed to adjacent rosettes (4, 6, 2, 8) -- the cross-shaped inner ring
3. Complete with corner rosettes (1, 3, 7, 9) -- potentially smallest labels
4. Finish with connecting pathway labels
5. Record all marginal text last
6. Cross-reference label vocabulary across rosettes for consistency

### 8.4 Scale-Dependent Ambiguity Protocol

At the extremely small label scale, glyph ambiguity will be higher than on any other folio:
- Flag all uncertain readings with confidence scores
- Record alternative readings where glyph identification is uncertain
- Use vocabulary frequency analysis to prefer readings that produce known words
- Cross-reference ambiguous labels with clearer labels on other folios (f67r, f88r) for letter-form calibration
- The k/t gallows distinction is the most critical ambiguity to manage

### 8.5 Cosmological Content Hypothesis

The Rosette foldout is widely hypothesized to represent a **map or cosmological diagram**:
- The nine rosettes may represent cities, regions, or celestial zones
- The connecting pathways may represent routes, rivers, or conceptual links
- Central features within individual rosettes (buildings, geographic forms) support a geographic interpretation
- Decoded labels should be checked against geographic and cosmological references
- This content hypothesis affects expected vocabulary: place names, directional terms, and categorical descriptors should be anticipated

### 8.6 Cross-Folio Diagram Comparison

The Rosette foldout should be compared with other diagram folios:
- **f67r (cosmological):** Similar curved-path label writing, but at larger scale. f67r serves as a scale reference for the same scribal technique at normal size.
- **f88r (pharmaceutical):** Label-writing conventions can be compared for cross-section consistency.
- **Zodiac folios:** Other circular diagrams in the manuscript may share label vocabulary or layout conventions with individual rosettes.
