## 2. Layout Description (Visual Analysis)

### 2.1 Page Structure

Folio 1r is the opening page of the manuscript. It is a **text-dominant folio** -- one of the few pages with extended paragraph text rather than illustration-centered layout.

**Paragraph structure (four paragraphs):**

| Paragraph | Approximate Lines | Termination | Special Features |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | 4.6 lines | Right-justified title line | No decorative initial |
| 2 | 2.4 lines | Right-justified title line | Large decorative "weirdo" initial (@252) |
| 3 | 9.5 lines | Right-justified title line | Large decorative "weirdo" initial (@253) |
| 4 | 5.5 lines | Right-justified title line | No decorative initial |

Each paragraph is followed by a short right-justified line that functions as a paragraph title or section marker. This right-justification pattern is unique to f1r in the manuscript and suggests a formal document structure (table of contents, preface, or title apparatus).

### 2.2 Illustration

A **plant illustration** appears in the middle of the page, positioned between paragraphs 2 and 3 (approximately). The plant features:
- Green and tan leaves
- Standard herbal-section style botanical rendering
- The illustration partially interrupts the text flow but does not dominate the page

### 2.3 Decorative Initials ("Weirdos")

Two large decorative initials appear at the beginnings of paragraphs 2 and 3:

- **@252 (paragraph 2):** V-shape with underbar or sideways-K form. Drawn in thick red/brown brushed strokes with distinctive **swallowtail serifs** at stroke terminations. This is NOT part of the normal script inventory -- it appears to be a rubricator's mark or decorative initial drawn by a different hand or instrument.

- **@253 (paragraph 3):** Similar to @252 but with an additional squiggly ascending line rising between the two horns of the V-shape. Same thick red/brown strokes and swallowtail serifs.

These initials are drawn in a markedly heavier hand than the body text, using what appears to be a broader pen or brush. They may represent section markers, decorative capitals, or cipher-key indicators. Their function remains uncertain.

## 3. Writing Characteristics Observed

### 3.1 General Hand Quality

This is the **most carefully written folio** in the manuscript. As the opening page, it exhibits:
- Maximum deliberation in letterform construction
- Clearest word boundaries of any folio examined
- Most consistent baseline management
- Well-formed gallows with full loop construction
- Even spacing between characters and between words

### 3.2 Baseline and Line Management

- **Baseline:** Extremely consistent. Virtually no wandering or drift across line length.
- **x-height:** Steady at approximately 2-3mm throughout all four paragraphs.
- **Line spacing:** Regular at approximately 6-8mm baseline-to-baseline.
- **Left margin:** Well-defined, with consistent indent. Paragraphs 2 and 3 have extra indent to accommodate the decorative initials.
- **Right margin:** Ragged for body text, but title lines are deliberately right-justified.

### 3.3 Word Spacing

Clear and consistent throughout. Word boundaries are unambiguous in this folio, making f1r the best reference for establishing baseline word-spacing norms. Approximate inter-word gap is 1.5-2mm, distinctly wider than intra-word character spacing (~0.5-1mm).

### 3.4 Ink and Pen

- Body text in standard brown/sepia iron gall ink
- Decorative initials @252 and @253 in heavier red/brown ink (possibly different instrument)
- Pen nib appears consistent with the rest of the manuscript: moderate broad nib (~0.5-1mm), slight left oblique cut
- No visible ink batch changes within the body text

## 4. Glyph Observations Specific to This Folio

### 4.1 Vowels

- **EVA 'o':** Perfectly circular at this speed. All closures complete. No ambiguity with 'a'. This is the reference standard for 'o' form.
- **EVA 'a':** Clear circle-plus-tail construction. The rightward connector tail is distinct and well-formed. No confusion with 'o' possible at this speed.
- **EVA 'e':** Crisp crescent shape, consistent opening on the right side. Stable form throughout.
- **EVA 'i':** Individual strokes clearly separated in sequences. In 'aiin' ligatures, the minims are still distinguishable as individual elements (though connected by pen movement).
- **EVA 'y':** Full descender with clear leftward curve. Descender length is at maximum for this folio (careful register).

### 4.2 Consonants

- **EVA 'r':** Hook clearly formed. No ambiguity with 'i' or 'n' at this speed.
- **EVA 'n':** Final-position minims are well-spaced and distinguishable from medial 'i' by context. At this speed, the word boundary after 'n' is always clear.
- **EVA 'l':** Height distinction from 'i' is at its maximum. Easy to distinguish in this folio.
- **EVA 'd':** Full loop-plus-ascender construction. The baseline loop is open and clear. Ascender reaches intermediate height (taller than x-height, shorter than gallows).

### 4.3 Operators

- **EVA 'ch':** Two-part construction clearly visible. The crescent-to-h transition shows a brief connecting stroke.
- **EVA 'sh':** All three visual components (s-curve, crescent, h-stroke) distinguishable.
- **EVA 'qo':** Written as a fluid unit but with distinguishable q-descender and o-circle at this speed.

### 4.4 Gallows

- **EVA 'k' (k-gallows):** Well-formed loop at top. Vertical stem is straight and tall (~2.5x x-height). Loop geometry clearly distinguishable from t-gallows.
- **EVA 't' (t-gallows):** Angular or offset loop clearly different from k-gallows. At this careful speed, the k/t distinction is at its clearest.
- **EVA 'f' (f-gallows):** Full elaborate construction with all flourishes rendered.
- **EVA 'p' (p-gallows):** Distinctive loop orientation visible.

### 4.5 Bench Gallows

- **EVA 'cth':** Appears in line 1 as "cth!res" -- the bench gallows compound is fully constructed with visible crescent-gallows-h flow. The "!" in EVA notation marks an uncertain reading point.

## 5. Speed / Ductus Notes

### 5.1 Speed Register

**Careful register throughout.** This is the most deliberate writing in the manuscript.

Evidence for careful register:
- No character compression
- No ligature shortcuts (all components individually distinguishable)
- Full gallows construction with complete loop geometry
- Maximum word-spacing clarity
- Full descender extension on 'y'
- No baseline drift

### 5.2 Ductus Observations

At this careful speed, individual pen movements are most visible:
- **Gallows ductus:** Vertical stem drawn top-to-bottom (downstroke), then pen lifts and constructs the loop from the top. This two-stroke construction is clearly evident in f1r.
- **'aiin' ductus:** The 'a' circle is drawn clockwise, tail extends rightward, then the pen continues without lift into the minim sequence (ii), which flows into the terminal stroke (n). Despite careful speed, this is a continuous movement.
- **'ch' ductus:** Crescent drawn with leftward curve, then without lift (or with minimal lift) the h-stroke follows.
- **'d' ductus:** Baseline loop drawn counterclockwise, then ascending stroke rises from the loop.

### 5.3 Pen Lifts

Visible pen lifts at this speed:
- Before and after gallows characters (except bench gallows where the crescent connects)
- Between words (always)
- Before decorative initials @252 and @253 (different instrument likely)
- Within paragraph title lines at right margin

## 6. Abbreviation Marks Observed

### 6.1 Gallows as Cluster Abbreviations

All four gallows types appear in f1r:
- **k-gallows** (EVA 'k'): Abbreviating /-st-/ or /-sk-/ cluster in medial position
- **t-gallows** (EVA 't'): Abbreviating /-tr-/ or /-tv-/ cluster in medial position
- **f-gallows** (EVA 'f'): Abbreviating /-pr-/ or /-fr-/ cluster -- present but less frequent

Word-initial operators visible in f1r:
- **qo-** (quantity/relative marker): Multiple instances
- **ch-** (action/directional operator): Frequent
- **sh-** (comitative operator): Present in multiple words

## 8. Transcription-Relevant Notes

### 8.1 Folio as Reference Standard

Folio 1r should be used as the **primary reference standard** for:
- Baseline character forms (all glyphs at maximum clarity)
- Word-boundary spacing norms (clearest word breaks in the manuscript)
- Gallows loop geometry (k vs. t distinction at maximum visibility)
- Full ligature construction before speed-induced compression
- Operator prefix identification (clear word-initial positions)

### 8.2 Paragraph Title Lines

The right-justified title lines at the end of each paragraph are unique to f1r. These may contain:
- Section headings for the content that follows in the manuscript
- A table of contents or index structure
- Summary labels for each paragraph's topic

Transcription should flag these lines as structurally distinct from body text.

### 8.3 Decorative Initials

The weirdos @252 and @253 should be:
- Transcribed as special characters, NOT mapped to the standard glyph inventory
- Noted as potentially written by a different hand or instrument (rubricator)
- Cross-referenced with any similar marks elsewhere in the manuscript

### 8.4 Validation Value

As the most carefully written folio, f1r provides:
- Ground truth for character identification in rapid-register folios
- Baseline for measuring speed-induced degradation in other folios
- Clear examples of every major glyph type in the inventory
- Unambiguous word boundaries for vocabulary analysis

### 8.5 Currier Language Classification

f1r is classified as **Currier Language A**, which aligns with the majority of the manuscript. The careful register and formal structure suggest this is not a speed variant but rather the scribe's most formal hand.
