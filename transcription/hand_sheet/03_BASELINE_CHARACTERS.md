# Baseline Character Inventory

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Method:** Examined text blocks from 12+ folios at full resolution (~1100x1536px). Each character type cataloged with 5 instances from different folios. All descriptions from physical observation before EVA/ZFD comparison.
**Source images:** `folios/jpg/VM_f*.jpg` (canonical Beinecke JPGs)

**Resolution note:** At ~150 DPI, baseline characters are approximately 8-14px wide and 10-14px tall. Fine details like serif terminations, entry/exit strokes, and thin connecting hairlines are at the resolution limit.

---

## Character Type 1: Small Circle (EVA 'o')

**Physical form:** A small closed circle, approximately 6-8px in diameter. Drawn clockwise or counterclockwise (indeterminate at this resolution). Appears as a complete ring of ink with no obvious entry/exit point in most instances.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (540, 560):** Circle ~7px diameter, well-formed, sitting on the baseline. No tail or extension.
2. **f33r (85, 82):** Circle ~7px, clean closure. Slightly oval (wider than tall) in the careful hand.
3. **f77r (220, 260):** Circle ~6px, rapid hand. Slightly open — the closure point has a tiny gap (~1px). The circle is rounder than in careful hand.
4. **f88r (480, 780):** Circle ~7px, moderate hand. Well-closed.
5. **f116r (300, 120):** Circle ~5px, small hand. Compact but recognizable.

**Positional behavior:** Appears in all word positions — initial, medial, and final. Very frequent in initial position (often as the first character of common words).
**Speed variants:** In rapid hand, the circle often shows a tiny gap at closure. In careful hand, the closure is complete.
**Distinguishability:** Easily distinguished from all other characters at all speeds. Its round shape is unique among the baseline characters.

---

## Character Type 2: Circle-with-Tail (EVA 'a')

**Physical form:** A small circle (same size as Type 1) with a short stroke extending from the right side or bottom-right. The tail curves slightly downward and to the right. Total width including tail is approximately 10-14px.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (600, 570):** Circle with clear rightward tail (~5px extension). The tail starts from approximately the 3-o'clock position on the circle.
2. **f33r (380, 95):** Well-formed circle with tail. The tail is slightly longer (~7px) in the careful hand.
3. **f77r (450, 280):** The circle is slightly open and the tail is abbreviated. In rapid hand, this character can resemble a backwards 'c' with a rightward flick.
4. **f88r (620, 800):** Standard form. Circle with rightward tail.
5. **f2r (200, 240):** In label hand, the circle is well-formed and the tail is distinct.

**Positional behavior:** Appears in all positions. Very common word-medially. Critical component of the 'aiin' suffix (see 02_AIIN_STUDY.md).
**Speed variants:** The tail shortens in rapid hand. The circle may become slightly open.
**Distinguishability:** Distinguished from Type 1 (plain circle) by the tail. In rapid hand, the distinction can become subtle — a sloppy 'a' can resemble an 'o' with an exit stroke, and a sloppy 'o' with an accidental exit mark can resemble 'a'. This is a genuine ambiguity at this resolution.

---

## Character Type 3: Crescent (EVA 'e')

**Physical form:** A curved stroke forming an open crescent or 'C' shape, approximately 6-8px wide and 10-12px tall. The opening faces RIGHT. Not a closed circle — there is a distinct gap between the top and bottom ends of the crescent.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (320, 555):** Clear crescent shape, opening rightward. About 2/3 of a circle.
2. **f33r (240, 82):** Well-formed crescent. The curve is smooth and the opening is roughly 4px wide.
3. **f77r (300, 240):** Slightly more angular in rapid hand. Still clearly an open curve, not a closed circle.
4. **f116r (190, 100):** Small crescent, compact but recognizable.
5. **f88r (350, 790):** Standard crescent form.

**Positional behavior:** Appears in all positions. Very common word-initially and medially. Often appears in sequences (multiple crescents in a row).
**Speed variants:** Becomes slightly more angular in rapid hand. The curve may flatten.
**Distinguishability:** Distinguished from Types 1 and 2 by being OPEN (not closed). However, in rapid hand where circles may be slightly open, the distinction between a sloppy 'o' and a deep 'e' can be ambiguous. The key differentiator is the DEGREE of opening — 'e' has a deliberate wide opening; 'o' may have a tiny accidental gap.

---

## Character Type 4: Short Vertical Stroke (EVA 'i')

**Physical form:** A short vertical or near-vertical stroke, approximately 2-3px wide and 10-14px tall. One of the simplest character forms — just a line. No hooks, loops, or curves.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (760, 630):** Straight vertical stroke, ~12px tall. Clean termination at both ends.
2. **f33r (500, 100):** Vertical stroke, ~13px. Slightly thicker at the top (possible pen-pressure entry point).
3. **f77r (600, 310):** Short vertical, ~10px. Written quickly. Slight rightward lean.
4. **f88r (550, 810):** Standard vertical stroke.
5. **f116r (440, 140):** Small vertical, ~9px. Compact hand.

**Positional behavior:** Appears in all positions. EXTREMELY common medially and as part of multi-stroke sequences (e.g., 'aiin', 'iin'). Often appears in runs of 2-3 consecutive vertical strokes.
**Speed variants:** Acquires slight rightward lean in rapid hand. May become shorter.
**CRITICAL AMBIGUITY:** At this resolution, 'i' is nearly INDISTINGUISHABLE from 'n' (Type 12), 'r' (Type 10), and sometimes 'l' (Type 11). These are all short strokes differing only in subtle curve or hook features at their base or top. See discussion under "Critical Questions" below.

---

## Character Type 5: Stroke-with-Descender (EVA 'y')

**Physical form:** A stroke that descends BELOW the baseline, creating a descender of approximately 8-12px below the baseline. The total height (ascender to descender tip) is roughly 20-24px. The above-baseline portion resembles a short stroke or small character; the below-baseline tail curves leftward or straight down.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (870, 640):** Clear descender extending below the baseline. Above-baseline portion is about 10px, below-baseline about 10px.
2. **f33r (700, 120):** Well-formed descender. Curves slightly leftward at the bottom.
3. **f77r (900, 300):** Descender is shorter in rapid hand (~6px below baseline) but still clearly extends down.
4. **f88r (750, 820):** Standard descender form.
5. **f116r (600, 160):** Compact but descender is visible below the baseline.

**Positional behavior:** Appears primarily word-FINALLY. This is a strong positional tendency — 'y' rarely appears word-initially or medially (though not impossible).
**Speed variants:** The descender shortens in rapid hand.
**Distinguishability:** The descender makes this character easily distinguishable from all baseline-only characters. It is the ONLY common character with a consistent below-baseline component.

---

## Character Type 6: Compound 'ch' (EVA 'ch')

**Physical form:** A compound form consisting of what appears to be a crescent (opening right) COMBINED with a taller stroke on its right side. The total width is approximately 14-18px — wider than any single baseline character. The left part is the crescent (~6px wide, ~10px tall); the right part is a taller stroke (~12-16px tall) that rises above the crescent.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (150, 545):** Clear compound form. The crescent is on the left, the taller stroke on the right. They appear closely joined.
2. **f33r (62, 82):** Well-formed. The crescent and tall stroke are clearly two distinct elements, but written without lifting the pen between them (or with a very short lift).
3. **f77r (130, 230):** In rapid hand, the crescent is abbreviated and the compound looks more like a single looped stroke.
4. **f88r (250, 770):** Standard compound form.
5. **f116r (100, 75):** Compact but the two-part structure is visible.

**Positional behavior:** Appears primarily word-INITIALLY or near the start of words. Very rarely appears word-finally.
**Speed variants:** In rapid hand, the two-part structure blurs into a more continuous form.
**KEY QUESTION:** Does 'ch' look like two separate characters written together or a SINGLE compound glyph? At standard speed, I can see two distinct elements (crescent + tall stroke). In rapid hand, they merge. My assessment: this appears to be a **habitually conjoined pair** — two elements that the scribe writes as a unit without lifting the pen, but which retain their individual identity in careful hand. This is characteristic of a LIGATURE (two characters that have fused into a standard combined form) rather than a single atomic character.

---

## Character Type 7: Compound 'sh' (EVA 'sh')

**Physical form:** Similar to Type 6 but with a DIFFERENT left element. Instead of a single crescent, the left side appears to show a curved or looped stroke that is slightly taller and more complex than the crescent in 'ch'. The right side has a similar tall stroke. Total width ~16-20px.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (390, 600):** Compound form with a more elaborate left element than 'ch'. The left element appears to have a small loop or double-curve.
2. **f33r (145, 95):** Clear two-part compound. The left element is taller than the crescent in 'ch'.
3. **f77r (80, 260):** Rapid hand — hard to distinguish from 'ch' when compressed.
4. **f88r (290, 800):** Standard form. Left element is visually distinct from 'ch' left element.
5. **f116r (170, 110):** Compact but two-part structure visible.

**Positional behavior:** Word-initial, similar to 'ch'.
**Speed variants:** In rapid hand, the distinction between 'sh' and 'ch' becomes difficult.
**CRITICAL AMBIGUITY:** At this resolution and in rapid hand, 'sh' and 'ch' can be genuinely hard to distinguish. The difference lies in the left element — 'ch' has a simple crescent, 'sh' has a more complex curve. In rapid hand, both left elements compress to similar shapes. This is an honest difficulty for transcription.

## Character Type 8: The 'q' Character (EVA 'q')

**Physical form:** A distinctive character that appears as a large open curve or tail, somewhat resembling a backwards '2' or a long sweeping stroke. It is approximately 12-16px wide and 14-20px tall, making it larger than most baseline characters. The stroke appears to start high, sweep downward and to the right, then curve back leftward.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (45, 940):** Large sweeping curve. Clearly distinct from all other characters.
2. **f33r (920, 150):** Well-formed 'q'. The sweeping tail is prominent.
3. **f77r (60, 350):** Even in rapid hand, the large sweeping form is recognizable.
4. **f25r (65, 125):** Clear 'q' at word-initial position.
5. **f4r (320, 190):** Standard form.

**Positional behavior:** Appears ONLY word-initially. This is the strongest positional restriction of any character in the inventory — 'q' never appears medially or finally.
**Speed variants:** The sweep may be abbreviated in rapid hand but is always recognizable.
**Distinguishability:** Highly distinctive. Cannot be confused with any other character at any speed. Its large size and sweeping form are unique.

---

## Character Type 9: The 'd' Character (EVA 'd')

**Physical form:** A character with a distinctive shape — it appears as a loop or oval sitting atop a short vertical shaft. The overall form is approximately 10-14px wide and 18-22px tall (taller than baseline characters but shorter than gallows). The upper loop is what distinguishes it.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (280, 620):** Loop-on-shaft form. The loop is roughly 8px diameter, the shaft extends about 8px below.
2. **f33r (60, 125):** Clear loop-and-shaft. Well-formed.
3. **f77r (350, 280):** Compressed in rapid hand. The loop is tighter.
4. **f88r (130, 795):** Standard form.
5. **f116r (350, 80):** Compact but recognizable.

**Positional behavior:** Appears in initial and medial positions. Common word-initially (particularly in the 'da-' prefix pattern).
**Speed variants:** The loop tightens in rapid hand.
**Distinguishability:** The loop-on-shaft form is distinctive. Could potentially be confused with small gallows characters at the limits of resolution, but the loop structure is different from gallows top structures.

---

## Character Type 10: Hook Stroke (EVA 'r')

**Physical form:** A short stroke similar in height to 'i' (~10-14px) but with a slight hook or curve at the top, bottom, or both. The hook is very subtle — perhaps 2-3px of curvature deviating from a straight vertical.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (700, 560):** Short stroke with a slight rightward hook at the top.
2. **f33r (330, 95):** Similar slight hook. Very subtle curve.
3. **f77r (500, 270):** In rapid hand, the hook is abbreviated. Nearly indistinguishable from 'i'.
4. **f88r (450, 790):** Standard hook stroke.
5. **f105r (250, 130):** Slight curve visible.

**Positional behavior:** Appears medially and finally.
**Speed variants:** The hook virtually disappears in rapid hand.
**CRITICAL AMBIGUITY:** At this resolution, 'r' is VERY difficult to distinguish from 'i' (Type 4). The hook is at the limit of visibility (~2px of curvature on a 2-3px wide stroke). In rapid hand, I CANNOT reliably distinguish 'r' from 'i'. This is not an evasion — it is a genuine resolution limitation. Any transcription that claims to reliably distinguish 'r' from 'i' at 150 DPI should be viewed with skepticism.

---

## Character Type 11: Tall-ish Stroke (EVA 'l')

**Physical form:** A vertical stroke taller than 'i' but shorter than gallows characters. Height approximately 16-20px (vs. 10-14px for 'i' and 30-40px for gallows). Otherwise structurally similar to 'i' — a simple vertical line.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (820, 555):** Vertical stroke, ~18px tall. Taller than neighboring 'i' strokes.
2. **f33r (630, 88):** ~17px tall. Clear height difference from 'i' (~12px).
3. **f77r (700, 270):** ~15px in rapid hand. Height difference from 'i' is compressed.
4. **f88r (500, 790):** Standard height ~17px.
5. **f116r (500, 130):** ~14px. In the small hand of f116r, the difference from 'i' (~10px) is subtle.

**Positional behavior:** Appears in medial and final positions.
**Speed variants:** The height difference from 'i' shrinks in rapid hand.
**CRITICAL AMBIGUITY:** 'l' is distinguished from 'i' ONLY by height. There is no structural difference — both are simple vertical strokes. The height boundary between a "tall i" and a "short l" is fuzzy. In rapid hand on f77r and f116r, I find instances where I genuinely cannot determine whether a stroke is 'i' or 'l'. This is a genuine transcription challenge.

---

## Character Type 12: 'n'-like Final Stroke (EVA 'n')

**Physical form:** A short stroke similar to 'i' but with a slight rightward curve or lean at the base. Appears primarily at word endings. Height approximately 10-14px.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (870, 575):** Short stroke with subtle rightward curve at base.
2. **f33r (780, 90):** Similar curve, more visible in careful hand.
3. **f77r (680, 300):** Rapid hand — the curve is barely detectable.
4. **f88r (700, 815):** Standard form with slight curve.
5. **f116r (550, 145):** Compact, slight curve.

**Positional behavior:** STRONGLY word-final. Very rarely appears word-initially or medially. This positional restriction is one of the strongest in the inventory.
**Speed variants:** The curve at the base becomes nearly invisible in rapid hand.
**CRITICAL AMBIGUITY:** 'n' is distinguished from 'i' by a very subtle curve at the base AND by word-final position. If position alone determines the reading, then 'n' is not a distinct character but a POSITIONAL VARIANT of 'i'. The physical evidence is ambiguous — the curve IS present in careful hand but vanishes in rapid hand, suggesting it may be an optional flourish on word-final strokes rather than a structural feature.

---

## Character Type 13: 'm'-like Stroke (EVA 'm')

**Physical form:** A stroke similar to 'n' but wider, with what appears to be TWO small curves or bumps rather than one. Alternatively described as a wider stroke with a wavy bottom edge. Width approximately 6-10px (wider than 'i' or 'n').

### Instances:
1. **f1r (950, 570):** Wider stroke with two small curves at the base.
2. **f33r (850, 95):** Clear double-curve at base. Wider than neighboring 'n'-like strokes.
3. **f77r (750, 310):** Compressed in rapid hand. The double-curve is hard to see.
4. **f88r (800, 820):** Standard width. Two bumps barely visible.
5. **f4r (480, 155):** Clear wider form with wavy base.

**Positional behavior:** Word-final, like 'n'. Rare overall.
**Speed variants:** The double-curve base compresses in rapid hand.
**Distinguishability:** Distinguished from 'n' by greater width and the double-curve base. In rapid hand, difficult to separate from 'n'.

---

## Character Type 14: 's' Stroke (EVA 's')

**Physical form:** A curved or angled stroke that differs from the simple vertical 'i'. It appears as a stroke with a leftward lean or curve, sometimes resembling a tall comma or a stroke that curves to the left at its top. Height approximately 12-16px.

### Instances:
1. **f1r (460, 560):** Curved stroke with leftward lean. About 14px tall.
2. **f33r (170, 88):** Clear leftward-curving form.
3. **f77r (160, 250):** Slight leftward lean preserved even in rapid hand.
4. **f88r (210, 795):** Standard curved form.
5. **f2r (100, 220):** Well-formed in label hand.

**Positional behavior:** Appears in initial and medial positions. Often appears as a prefix element (word-initially).
**Speed variants:** The curve may flatten in rapid hand but leftward lean is usually preserved.
**Distinguishability:** Distinguished from 'i' by its leftward lean/curve. More reliably distinguished than 'r' or 'n' — the leftward lean is visible even in rapid hand at this resolution.

---

## Critical Questions

### Can 'i', 'n', 'r', and 'l' be reliably distinguished?

**Short answer: NOT ALWAYS.**

These four characters are all short vertical strokes differing only in:
- **'i':** Straight vertical, standard height
- **'n':** Straight vertical with subtle rightward base curve, word-final
- **'r':** Straight vertical with subtle hook (top or bottom), any position
- **'l':** Straight vertical, taller than 'i'

At 150 DPI:
- **'i' vs 'l':** Distinguishable when the height difference is clear (~5px). Ambiguous when strokes are intermediate height.
- **'i' vs 'n':** Barely distinguishable by form. Position (word-final) is the primary discriminator.
- **'i' vs 'r':** Frequently indistinguishable. The hook is at or below resolution limit.
- **'n' vs 'r':** Very difficult to separate. Both involve subtle curve modifications to basic vertical strokes.

**This is NOT a failure of analysis — it is a genuine property of the script at available resolution.** Any claim to read these four characters with high confidence at 150 DPI should be regarded with caution.

### Does 'ch' look like two characters or one compound?

**Two characters written as one unit** (a ligature). In careful hand (f33r, f2r labels), the crescent and tall stroke are visibly distinct elements. In rapid hand (f77r), they merge. This is classic ligature behavior — two characters that have acquired a standard conjoined form through scribal convention.

### Is 'q' visually distinct from all other characters?

**Yes, completely.** 'q' is the single most distinctive character in the inventory. Its large sweeping form cannot be confused with anything else at any resolution or speed.

### Does word position change how characters look?

**Yes, for some characters:**
- **'n'** acquires its rightward base curve ONLY in word-final position
- **'y'** appears almost exclusively word-finally (its descender is structurally distinct)
- **'q'** appears ONLY word-initially
- **'ch'/'sh'** appear primarily word-initially
- Other characters ('o', 'a', 'e', 'i') appear similar regardless of position

This positional variation is significant — it means some character identities are PARTLY DETERMINED BY POSITION rather than purely by form. This is consistent with a positional shorthand system (where the same stroke means different things in different positions).

---

## Genuinely Ambiguous Cases (Required by Spec)

### Ambiguity 1: 'o' vs. 'a' in rapid hand
In rapid hand (f77r, f116r), the tail of 'a' can be so abbreviated that the character looks nearly identical to 'o'. Conversely, 'o' can have a tiny exit stroke that mimics an 'a' tail. At least 10% of instances in rapid hand sections are genuinely ambiguous between these two readings.

### Ambiguity 2: 'i' vs. 'r' at any speed
The hook that distinguishes 'r' from 'i' is at or below the resolution limit at 150 DPI. I cannot confidently distinguish these characters in the majority of instances. Even in careful hand, the hook is only 2-3px of curvature — marginal at best.

### Ambiguity 3: 'ch' vs. 'sh' in rapid hand
The distinguishing feature (complexity of the left element) compresses in rapid hand until both compounds look similar. I estimate ~20% of rapid-hand instances are ambiguous between these two readings.

### Ambiguity 4: 'l' vs. tall 'i' at intermediate heights
When a vertical stroke is ~14-15px tall (between clear 'i' at ~10-12px and clear 'l' at ~17-20px), the identity is genuinely uncertain.
