## What CAN Be Determined at 150 DPI

| Observation | Confidence | Evidence Quality |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Character TYPE identification (18 types) | HIGH | Characters are 8-15px wide, sufficient for type classification |
| Gallows vs. baseline distinction | HIGH | Gallows are 2.5-3x taller, clearly visible |
| Word boundary identification | HIGH in careful hand, MODERATE in rapid | Word gaps (8-12px) are clearly wider than char gaps (3-6px) in careful hand |
| Single scribe assessment | HIGH | Character repertoire and proportions are consistent |
| Speed register classification | HIGH | Measurable differences in x-height, spacing, character formation |
| 'aiin' compressed spacing | HIGH | Spacing difference (2-3px vs 5-6px) is measurable |
| Positional tendencies (initial/medial/final) | HIGH | Position within words is observable |
| Gallows absence of abbreviation marks | HIGH | If marks existed at scale of the characters, they would be visible |
| 'ch'/'sh' two-component structure | MODERATE-HIGH | Visible in careful hand; fused in rapid |

## What CANNOT Be Determined at 150 DPI

| Observation | Why Not | What Would Be Needed |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Pen-lift points** | Individual strokes are 2-3px wide; pen lifts would be <1px gaps | 300+ DPI, or multispectral imaging |
| **Stroke order** | Cannot be determined from static images at any resolution | Video of writing, or ink-layering analysis |
| **'i' vs. 'r' distinction** | The hook differentiating 'r' (~2px curvature) is at resolution limit | 300+ DPI minimum |
| **'i' vs. 'n' formal distinction** | The rightward base curve of 'n' is ~1-2px of deviation | 300+ DPI minimum |
| **'l' vs. tall 'i' boundary** | Height difference at intermediate sizes is ~3-4px | Higher res helps marginally; may be inherently continuous |
| **'o' vs. 'a' in rapid hand** | Tail of 'a' abbreviates to ~1-2px in rapid hand | 300+ DPI or infrared (to see faint ink) |
| **'ch' vs. 'sh' in rapid hand** | Left-element distinction compresses to ~2-3px differences | 300+ DPI minimum |
| **Internal structure of gallows tops** | Loop/flourish details are 3-5px features | 300+ DPI |
| **Ink pooling/flow direction** | Below 150 DPI visibility | 600+ DPI or microscopy |
| **Possible crossbar in Type C gallows** | Feature is ~1-2px if it exists | 300+ DPI |
| **Whether 'aiin' is truly one pen movement** | Pen lifts between strokes are invisible at 150 DPI | Needs ink-layer analysis or 600+ DPI |

## What REQUIRES Different Methodology (Not Just Higher Resolution)

| Question | Why Resolution Alone Is Insufficient | What's Needed |
|----------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Are gallows cluster abbreviations?** | This is a LINGUISTIC claim, not a physical one. Physical evidence can show structure but not phonemic value. | Linguistic analysis + comparative paleography against known Glagolitic abbreviated forms |
| **Sound values of characters** | No amount of physical observation can determine what sounds a script represents | Linguistic analysis, bilingual texts, or known-word identifications |
| **Whether the script is a shorthand** | Physical observation shows positional patterns consistent with shorthand but cannot prove it | Linguistic validation — do the decoded words form meaningful text? |
| **Scribe's training tradition** | Physical similarity to a script tradition (e.g., Glagolitic) requires comparative analysis against exemplars | Access to Glagolitic cursive manuscripts for direct comparison |
| **Whether this is Croatian** | A language identification requires linguistic analysis, not paleographic | Morphological analysis of decoded word forms |

## Recommendations

### For Continued Work at Current Resolution (~150 DPI)
- Focus on character TYPE identification (reliable) rather than exact character instance readings (unreliable for i/n/r/l)
- Use POSITIONAL context to disambiguate (if word-final, read as 'n' not 'i'; this is an interpretive rule, not a physical observation)
- Acknowledge ~5-20% error rate in character-level readings depending on speed register
- Use careful-hand instances as the reference for character identification; rapid-hand instances will have higher error rates

### For Improved Physical Analysis
- **300 DPI scans** would resolve many of the marginal distinctions (i/r, o/a, ch/sh) and allow pen-lift analysis
- **Multispectral imaging** would reveal ink layers and potentially determine stroke order
- **UV fluorescence** might reveal erased or faded marks (including possible abbreviation marks that have faded)

### For Validation of ZFD Hypothesis
- Physical observation alone CANNOT validate or refute the linguistic claims
- The strongest paleographic contribution would be **comparative analysis** against known Croatian Glagolitic cursive manuscripts from the 14th-15th century — looking for physical parallels in character forms, abbreviation conventions, and scribal habits
- Such comparison would require access to photographed exemplars of Glagolitic notarial/pharmaceutical documents

## Honest Self-Assessment

This hand sheet was produced from images at approximately 150 DPI effective resolution. At this resolution:

- **I am confident** in: character type inventory, gallows classification, single-scribe assessment, speed register analysis, positional patterns, 'aiin' spacing compression, absence of abbreviation marks.
- **I am uncertain about**: fine stroke details, pen-lift patterns, internal gallows structure, i/n/r/l distinctions, exact boundary between 'o' and 'a' in rapid hand.
- **I cannot determine**: sound values, linguistic identity, scribal training tradition, whether this is specifically Croatian Glagolitic cursive.

The work could NOT have been produced without looking at images — the speed register analysis, the 'aiin' spacing measurement, the gallows study (especially the absence of abbreviation marks), and the ambiguity documentation all derive from direct physical observation. However, some observations that would require higher resolution are reported as uncertain rather than fabricated with false confidence.
