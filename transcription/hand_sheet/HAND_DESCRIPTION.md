## 1. General Hand Characteristics

### 1.1 Script Classification

The Voynich scribe writes in a **positional shorthand system** derived from Croatian Angular Glagolitic cursive, specifically the "office script" (notarial cursive) used for trade records and pharmaceutical recipes in the Ragusa (Dubrovnik) milieu, c. 1404-1438.

The script is NOT a cipher alphabet. It is a **functional abbreviation system** where:
- Word-initial characters function as grammatical operators
- Medial tall characters (gallows) abbreviate consonant clusters
- Word-final characters mark morphological suffixes
- Ligatures compress frequent character sequences into single pen movements

### 1.2 Writing Instrument

- **Pen type:** Quill or reed pen with a moderately broad nib (~0.5-1mm writing edge)
- **Nib cut:** Slight left oblique cut, producing thicker strokes on downward/leftward movements and thinner strokes on upward/rightward movements
- **Ink:** Brown/sepia iron gall ink (main text); some folios show slight color variation suggesting ink batch changes or fading
- **Writing surface:** Vellum (calf parchment), generally well-prepared with ruled guidelines visible under UV

### 1.3 Overall Metrics

- **x-height (baseline characters):** ~2-3mm in body text, consistent across sections
- **Ascender height (gallows):** ~6-8mm, approximately 2.5-3x the x-height
- **Line spacing:** ~6-8mm baseline to baseline in body text; slightly wider in pharmaceutical labels
- **Slant:** Near-vertical to slight rightward lean (~2-5 degrees from vertical)
- **Regularity:** High. The scribe maintains consistent letter proportions across the entire manuscript, indicating professional training
- **Text direction:** Left to right, consistent throughout

### 1.4 Writing Speed Assessment

Three distinct speed registers observed:

| Register | Context | Characteristics | Example Folios |
|----------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Careful** | Opening page, section starts, important labels | Well-formed characters, clear word spacing, deliberate gallows construction | f1r (paragraphs 1-2), f88r labels |
| **Standard** | Body text in herbal and pharmaceutical sections | Fluent but controlled, occasional ligature shortcuts, consistent rhythm | f2r, f3r, f33v, f56r, f87r |
| **Rapid** | Dense text passages, biological section, late manuscript | Slightly compressed characters, more ligature merging, occasional word-boundary ambiguity | f77r, f99r body text |

### 1.5 Consistency Across Manuscript

Based on examination across all sections:
- **Single scribe:** The hand is fundamentally consistent throughout. Letter proportions, gallows construction, baseline management, and spacing habits remain stable from f1r through f116r.
- **Currier's "Hand 1"** designation is consistent with all examined folios (though Currier's "Hand 2" may represent speed variation rather than a different scribe).
- **Section-specific adaptations:** Labels near illustrations tend toward the "Careful" register. Body text in dense passages trends toward "Rapid." The scribe adapts pace to context without changing fundamental letterforms.

## 2. Glyph Inventory -- Baseline Characters

### 2.1 Vowels and Semi-Vowels

**EVA 'o' -- /o/ (On)**
- **Form:** Small circle or near-circle, approximately 2mm diameter
- **Stroke count:** 1 (single clockwise rotation from ~11 o'clock position)
- **Position:** All positions; 32% word-initial (operator function: "about/topic marker")
- **Distinguishing feature:** Fully closed circle. When word-initial, may be slightly larger.
- **Speed variants:** At rapid speed, becomes slightly elliptical; at very rapid speed may not fully close, risking confusion with EVA 'a'

**EVA 'a' -- /a/ (Az)**
- **Form:** Similar to 'o' but with a rightward tail or connector stroke extending from the upper right
- **Stroke count:** 1-2 (circle + connector, or single continuous stroke)
- **Position:** Primarily medial (87.0%)
- **Distinguishing feature:** The connector tail distinguishes it from 'o'. The tail links to the following character, making 'a' inherently a "connecting" letter.
- **Speed variants:** At rapid speed, the circle portion may be reduced to a curved stroke, making 'a' look more like a cursive lowercase 'a'

**EVA 'e' -- /e/ (Est)**
- **Form:** Small crescent or c-shape, open to the right
- **Stroke count:** 1 (single leftward curve)
- **Position:** Primarily medial (98.6%)
- **Distinguishing feature:** Always open on the right side. Never closes into a circle.
- **Speed variants:** Minimal variation; this is one of the most stable characters across all speeds
- **CRITICAL NOTE:** EVA 'e' is the first element of 'ch' and 'sh' clusters. When followed by specific strokes, it becomes part of a cluster, NOT a standalone vowel.

**EVA 'i' -- /i/ (Izhe)**
- **Form:** Short vertical stroke, sometimes with a very slight rightward curve at the top
- **Stroke count:** 1 (single downstroke)
- **Position:** Medial (99.8%)
- **Distinguishing feature:** Shorter than 'l', without the descender of 'y'. Often appears in sequences: 'ii', 'iii', 'iiii' (especially in 'aiin', 'aiiin' patterns)
- **Speed variants:** In rapid writing, sequences of multiple 'i' strokes may merge into a wavy line
- **CRITICAL NOTE:** The 'ii' and 'iii' sequences within 'aiin' / 'aiiin' may represent a **single ligature unit**, not individual letters. See Ligature Catalog.

**EVA 'y' -- /i/ adjective suffix (Jer)**
- **Form:** Like 'i' but with a descending tail below the baseline, curving leftward
- **Stroke count:** 1-2 (downstroke + descender curve, or continuous stroke)
- **Position:** Primarily final (84.5% word-final)
- **Distinguishing feature:** The descender clearly distinguishes it from 'i'. Functions as an adjective/genitive marker.
- **Speed variants:** Descender length varies; in rapid writing may be abbreviated to a short hook

### 2.2 Consonants (Simple)

**EVA 'n' -- /n/ (Nash)**
- **Form:** Short vertical stroke similar to 'i', possibly with a slight rightward hook at the base
- **Stroke count:** 1
- **Position:** Primarily final (95.4%)
- **Distinguishing feature:** Context-dependent distinction from 'i'. When word-final, an 'i'-like stroke is read as 'n' (noun ending).
- **NOTE:** The visual similarity between 'i' and 'n' is one of EVA's weaknesses. In the shorthand system, POSITION determines whether this stroke is /i/ (medial) or /n/ (final).

**EVA 'r' -- /r/ (Rtsi)**
- **Form:** Short stroke with a characteristic hook or curve, possibly resembling a lowercase 'r'
- **Stroke count:** 1
- **Position:** Mixed; 73.4% final (agent marker), also medial in some stems
- **Distinguishing feature:** The hook distinguishes it from 'i'/'n'

**EVA 'l' -- /l/ (Lyudi)**
- **Form:** Slightly taller than 'i', a vertical stroke that may have a small foot or serif
- **Stroke count:** 1
- **Position:** 53.0% final (noun ending), also medial
- **Distinguishing feature:** Height intermediate between baseline 'i' and gallows ascenders

**EVA 's' -- /s/**
- **Form:** A curved or angled stroke, often appearing as part of 'sh' cluster
- **Stroke count:** 1
- **Position:** Almost always part of 'sh' cluster; rarely standalone
- **NOTE:** In the ZFD framework, standalone 's' is rare. Most 's' appearances are as the first element of the 'sh' operator.

**EVA 'd' -- /d/ (Dobro)**
- **Form:** A character with a taller ascending stroke, resembling a 'd' with a curved or looped ascender
- **Stroke count:** 2 (baseline loop + ascender stroke)
- **Position:** 26% word-initial (operator: "to/until"), also medial and final
- **Distinguishing feature:** The ascender is shorter than gallows but taller than baseline characters. The baseline portion has a distinctive loop.

**EVA 'm' -- /m/**
- **Form:** Short stroke, possibly with multiple minims
- **Stroke count:** 1-2
- **Position:** Primarily final (91.4% -- instrumental case marker)
- **Distinguishing feature:** Context-dependent

### 2.3 Operator Characters (Word-Initial Function)

**EVA 'q' -- /k/ (relative operator)**
- **Form:** A distinctive character appearing almost exclusively word-initial (98.5%). Resembles a descending stroke with a connecting tail to the following 'o'.
- **Stroke count:** 1-2
- **Position:** Almost always initial, almost always followed by 'o' (forming 'qo' = /ko/)
- **Distinguishing feature:** Unique form found only at word beginnings. The 'qo' combination is so frequent it should be treated as a single operator glyph.
- **CRITICAL NOTE:** 'q' alone = /k/; 'qo' = /ko/ (which/that/quantity). Detection order: 'qo' before 'q'.

**EVA 'ch' -- /h/ or /x/ (action operator)**
- **Form:** A compound character: crescent 'c' (similar to 'e') connected to a stroke 'h'
- **Stroke count:** 2 (crescent + vertical/curved stroke), but written as a connected unit
- **Position:** ~50% word-initial (operator: "combine/cook"), also medial
- **Distinguishing feature:** The 'c' component is identical to standalone 'e' in shape, but the immediate following 'h' stroke distinguishes the cluster. This is a LIGATURE, not two separate characters.

**EVA 'sh' -- /sh/ (comitative operator)**
- **Form:** Similar to 'ch' but with an additional 's' element preceding the 'c'+'h'
- **Stroke count:** 2-3
- **Position:** ~58% word-initial (operator: "with/soak")
- **Distinguishing feature:** The leading 's' curve distinguishes it from 'ch'

## 3. Glyph Inventory -- Gallows Characters

The four gallows characters are the most distinctive feature of Voynich script. They are **abbreviation marks** that expand into consonant clusters, NOT standalone letters.

### 3.1 Gallows Overview

All four gallows share:
- Tall vertical stems extending ~2.5-3x x-height above the baseline
- A looped or crossed structure at the top
- Connection points at baseline level for preceding and following characters
- Position primarily medial (85-90%)

### 3.2 Individual Gallows

**EVA 'k' -- /-st-/ or /-sk-/ (Kako-derived)**
- **Form:** Tall vertical stem with a single loop at the top, resembling a stylized lowercase 'k' or a figure-8 with an extended vertical
- **Stroke count:** 2-3 (vertical stem + loop construction)
- **Position:** 89.9% medial
- **Expansion:** -st- cluster (most common), -sk- in some contexts
- **Key productions:** kost (bone), korist (use/benefit), kal (vessel)
- **Ductus:** Vertical stem drawn downward, then pen lifts and constructs loop from top
- **Frequency:** Most common gallows (~2000+ occurrences)
- **Status:** CONFIRMED

**EVA 't' -- /-tr-/ or /-tv-/ (Tvrdo-derived)**
- **Form:** Tall vertical stem with a slightly different loop configuration than 'k' -- the loop may be more angular or offset
- **Stroke count:** 2-3
- **Position:** 85.3% medial
- **Expansion:** -tr- cluster (most common), -tv- in some contexts
- **Key productions:** otr- (treated), itra (liver)
- **Ductus:** Similar to 'k' but with distinct loop geometry
- **Frequency:** Second most common gallows (~1500+)
- **Status:** CONFIRMED

**EVA 'f' -- /-pr-/ or /-fr-/ (Frt-derived)**
- **Form:** More elaborate than 'k' or 't', possibly with double loops or additional flourishes
- **Stroke count:** 3-4
- **Position:** 72.7% medial
- **Expansion:** -pr- or -fr- cluster
- **Key productions:** upra (direction), cpho- (from)
- **Ductus:** More complex construction requiring additional pen movements
- **Frequency:** ~800 occurrences
- **Status:** CONFIRMED

**EVA 'p' -- /-pl-/ or /-sp-/ (Pokoj-derived)**
- **Form:** Tall character with loop structure, distinguished from other gallows by specific loop orientation
- **Stroke count:** 2-3
- **Position:** 65.5% medial
- **Expansion:** -pl- or -sp- cluster
- **Key productions:** spoj (join), plod (fruit)
- **Ductus:** Distinct loop construction from 'k' and 't'
- **Frequency:** ~600 occurrences
- **Status:** CONFIRMED

### 3.3 Gallows + 'h' Compounds (Bench Gallows)

When gallows are preceded by 'c' (the crescent), they form "bench gallows" -- EVA 'ckh', 'cth', 'cph', 'cfh'. These are compound abbreviation marks:

- **'cth'** = ch + t-gallows = /h/ + /-tr-/ = combined abbreviation for longer cluster
- **'ckh'** = ch + k-gallows = /h/ + /-st-/ = combined abbreviation
- **'cph'** = ch + p-gallows = /h/ + /-pl-/
- **'cfh'** = ch + f-gallows = /h/ + /-pr-/

These compounds show continuous pen movement from the crescent through the gallows, indicating they were conceived as single graphic units.

## 4. Ligature Catalog Summary

### 4.1 High-Frequency Ligatures

| Ligature | Components | Frequency | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| qo | q + o | ~2000+ | Almost always a unit; the 'q' rarely appears without 'o' |
| ch | c + h | ~3000+ | Operator or cluster initial; the 'c' is identical to standalone 'e' |
| sh | s + h | ~2000+ | Operator; the 's' connects directly to 'ch' |
| aiin | a + ii + n | ~1500+ | Suffix unit; written with continuous pen movement |
| aiiin | a + iii + n | ~300+ | Extended form of aiin |
| daiin | d + aiin | ~800+ | Operator 'd' + suffix unit 'aiin' |
| or | o + r | ~1000+ | Common stem/suffix combination |
| ol | o + l | ~800+ | Oil/liquid marker |
| al | a + l | ~600+ | Substance marker |
| ar | a + r | ~600+ | Water/agent marker |
| ey | e + y | ~1000+ | Common final sequence |
| edy | e + d + y | ~500+ | Process suffix |
| dy | d + y | ~400+ | Adjective ending variant |
| ain | a + i + n | ~400+ | Short form of aiin |

### 4.2 Ligature Behavior Observations

From manuscript examination:
1. **'aiin' is a unit:** In all observed instances, the 'a-ii-n' sequence shows continuous pen movement without clear lift points between components. The 'ii' portion shows connected minims rather than separate strokes.
2. **'qo' is a unit:** The 'q' descender connects directly to the 'o' circle with a single pen movement. These are never separated by a word boundary.
3. **'ch'/'sh' are units:** The crescent and following stroke are always written as connected movements.
4. **Gallows + following vowel** often show connected pen movement, suggesting the gallows is designed to flow into the stem vowel.

## 5. Abbreviation Marks and Conventions

### 5.1 Gallows as Abbreviation Marks

The primary abbreviation convention is the use of gallows characters to represent consonant clusters:

| Mark | Type | Expansion | Certainty |
|------|------|-----------|-----------|
| k-gallows | Cluster abbreviation | -st-/-sk- | HIGH |
| t-gallows | Cluster abbreviation | -tr-/-tv- | HIGH |
| f-gallows | Cluster abbreviation | -pr-/-fr- | HIGH |
| p-gallows | Cluster abbreviation | -pl-/-sp- | HIGH |

### 5.2 Operator Prefixes as Abbreviation

Word-initial operators abbreviate grammatical function words:

| Operator | Full form | Function |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| qo- | ko- | relative/quantity marker |
| ch- | h-/x- | action/directional |
| sh- | s-/sh- | comitative (with) |
| da- | da- | dative/dose |
| o- | o- | topic marker |

### 5.3 Suffix Abbreviations

Word-final characters abbreviate morphological endings:

| Suffix | Croatian | Function |
|--------|----------|----------|
| -y | -i | adjective/genitive |
| -aiin | -ain | substance noun |
| -edy | -edi | processed/prepared |
| -eey | -ei | instance |
| -n | -n | noun ending |
| -l | -l | noun ending |
| -r | -r | agent |
| -m | -m | instrumental |
| -am | -am | instrumental (full) |
| -om | -om | instrumental (full) |

## 6. Spacing and Layout Behavior

### 6.1 Word Boundaries

- **Primary delimiter:** Small horizontal space (~1-2mm in body text)
- **Consistency:** Generally reliable, but in rapid writing, word boundaries can narrow, causing ambiguity
- **EVA notation:** Word boundaries marked with '.' in the transcription

### 6.2 Line Management

- **Justification:** Left-aligned; right margin is ragged
- **Line breaks:** Generally respect word boundaries; hyphenation is not observed
- **Labels:** Often written along curved paths following illustration contours (visible in f67r, f88r)

### 6.3 Paragraph Structure (f1r)

- **Paragraph breaks:** Clear vertical gaps between paragraphs
- **Paragraph initials:** On f1r, paragraphs 2 and 3 begin with large decorative initials ("weirdos" @252, @253) drawn in a different, heavier hand -- possibly rubricator's marks
- **Titles:** Short right-justified lines at paragraph ends (f1r)

### 6.4 Text-Illustration Integration

- **Herbal folios:** Text wraps around plant illustrations, with breaks marked '<->' in EVA notation where the plant interrupts a line
- **Pharmaceutical folios:** Text in blocks between apparatus illustrations; labels placed near relevant diagram features
- **Zodiac/cosmological:** Labels distributed around circular diagrams in curved text paths
- **Biological:** Dense text blocks with figure illustrations in margins

---

## 7. Section-Specific Observations

### 7.1 Herbal Section (f3r, f13v, f33v, f56r)

- Dominant content: Plant illustrations with surrounding text and occasional labels
- Text wraps around illustrations, sometimes interrupted mid-line
- Writing speed: Standard register, consistent with f2r
- Plant labels tend toward careful register
- Vocabulary heavy in stems related to botanical terms (roots, leaves, flowers)

### 7.2 Pharmaceutical Section (f87r, f88r, f99r, pharma_0175)

- Distinctive layout: Stacked tiered vessel illustrations (red/brown/green) along left margin
- Root and plant illustrations in middle/right areas
- Text in blocks between illustrations
- Labels above root illustrations and near vessel diagrams
- f88r shows the strongest validation evidence: labels spatially correlated with apparatus components
- Writing speed: Labels careful, body text standard to rapid
- Vocabulary: pharmaceutical process terms, vessel names, ingredient references

### 7.3 Cosmological Section (f67r)

- Two circular diagrams: sun-face mandala (left) and moon-phase diagram (right)
- Labels distributed around concentric rings
- Text at top and bottom of pages
- Labels are smaller and written along curved paths
- Writing follows the circular geometry of the diagrams

### 7.4 Biological Section (f77r)

- Human figures (nude) in illustration at top with pipe/tube structures
- Dense text in three large blocks below
- Among the densest text in the manuscript
- Writing speed: Standard to rapid; this section has some of the most compressed text
- Vocabulary may differ from pharmaceutical sections

### 7.5 Rosette Foldout (f85v-86r)

- Large six-panel foldout with nine circular rosette diagrams
- Text in tiny labels around and within rosettes
- Labels are very small, written in careful register despite size
- This is the most diagram-heavy spread in the manuscript
