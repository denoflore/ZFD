## f1r — Opening Page (JP2 0002)

The page is organized into 4 distinct text blocks separated by a botanical illustration (green-painted leaves on stems). The first impression is of **deliberate, measured writing** — the scribe is writing carefully here, as befits an opening page. Letter forms are upright and well-spaced. The most striking feature is the **two large decorated initials** rendered in dark red/brown ink, one at the start of the second block and one at the third. These are flourished paragraph markers — they look like stylized capital letters with curling extensions, significantly larger than the body text (roughly 3-4x the x-height).

The body text uses a consistent brown ink. Lines are reasonably straight with fairly even spacing. Word boundaries appear to be marked by small gaps, though some words seem to run together. The script flows left-to-right with a slight rightward lean. The most distinctive visual feature of the script itself is the **looped/circular small characters** — many characters appear as small circles or circles-with-tails, giving the text a "bubbly" or rounded appearance quite unlike Latin or Germanic hands. There are occasional tall characters that project above the baseline — these are notably taller (roughly 2.5-3x x-height) and have a distinctive looped or capped top.

The bottom text block appears slightly more compressed and hurried than the top — the line spacing is tighter and character spacing slightly more irregular.

## f33v — Mid-Herbal (JP2 0065)

A botanical illustration dominates — a plant with star-shaped green leaves and two large oval seed-pod/caterpillar-like structures at the top, plus two circular rosette objects at the bottom. Text wraps around the illustration in two columns (left column alongside the plant, right column to its right).

The writing here feels **faster and more compact** than f1r. Characters are slightly smaller and more tightly spaced. The same rounded/circular character forms are present, but they're written with less deliberation — some of the small circles appear slightly open or elliptical rather than perfectly round. The tall characters are still present and still stand out clearly against the baseline text.

A striking feature: the text in the **left column wraps tightly around the illustration contour**, suggesting the illustration was drawn first and the text fitted around it. The line lengths vary considerably. The right column is more regular.

Labels appear near the illustration — short words/phrases near the plant parts. These label-hand characters appear similar in size to the body text, perhaps very slightly larger. No obvious change in hand between labels and body text at this resolution.

## f88r — Pharmaceutical (JP2 0160)

This page is dramatically different from the herbal pages. It shows **colored jar/vessel illustrations** on the left margin (tall vessels with red and blue/teal bands stacked in tiers, like graduated flasks) and **botanical root illustrations** across the top and middle (plants shown uprooted with exposed root systems in brown/tan ink, with green leaf patches).

The text is organized into three blocks: labels at the very top (short words above the plant illustrations), a middle paragraph between the two rows of illustrations, and a bottom paragraph. The **labels** are the most interesting — they're written in a looser, quicker hand above each plant root, appearing as single short words. At this resolution they look more casually written than the body text paragraphs.

The body text in the paragraphs maintains the same rounded character forms seen in the herbal section. The writing looks **moderately paced** — not as careful as f1r, not as hurried as the densest parts of f33v. The jar labels on the left side use very small text, tightly squeezed next to the illustrations.

A "88" is visible in the upper right corner (later foliation in a different hand). The folio number "88" is written in a clearly different, more modern hand.

## f77r — Biological (JP2 0138)

This is the most visually complex page. It shows **nude female figures** (nymphs) in an architectural setting — figures appear in a green-colored pool/channel structure with what looks like pipes or conduits. Above this illustration is a dense paragraph of text. Below are two more paragraphs of dense text. Small labels appear along the top edge inside a scalloped border, and along the right margin.

The body text is **the densest writing observed so far**. The paragraph above the illustration runs for approximately 15 lines of tightly-packed text with minimal line spacing. The writing appears **rapid** — characters are slightly smaller, more angular, and less carefully formed than on f1r. The circular characters are still round, but the connecting strokes between words seem quicker. Some characters appear to merge into their neighbors more than on other pages.

The **labels along the top scalloped border** are notably different from the body text — they're written at a larger size, more spaced out, and appear to label individual nymph figures or architectural features. These labels look carefully written, possibly even more carefully than the body text.

The right margin has text written vertically (rotated 90 degrees), which appears to be in the same hand as the body text.

The word "Morano" or similar appears in the bottom left — this looks like it could be a later addition in a different ink.

## f116r — Near End (JP2 0204)

A page of dense text with **no illustrations** — this is pure text, possibly a recipe or procedural section. The writing fills the entire page in a single column. The text is organized into what appear to be paragraphs (slight indentation or spacing between groups of lines, and some lines end short of the right margin).

The hand here is **noticeably different from the herbal/pharmaceutical sections**. The writing is smaller, more tightly packed, and appears to use a finer pen point. The character shapes are the same basic repertoire (round forms, tall characters), but everything is scaled down. The text appears **slightly more angular** than the earlier pages — the circles are less perfectly round, some appearing as ovals or slightly flattened.

Star-shaped decorations (6-pointed or 8-pointed) appear scattered in the left margin and between paragraphs. These are drawn as simple asterisks, not elaborate — they seem to serve as paragraph markers or section dividers.

The most striking difference from earlier pages: this folio appears to have been written in a **more hurried, running hand**. Words seem to flow into each other more, and the interword spacing is less clear. The ink also appears slightly different — a slightly darker brown, possibly indicating a different sitting or pen.

The overall impression is of a scribe working through a large amount of text systematically, maintaining consistency but at a faster pace than the carefully composed herbal pages.

## Cross-Folio Observations

1. **Single scribe impression:** Despite the variation in speed and care, the basic character repertoire appears identical across all 5 folios. The same rounded small characters, the same tall looped characters, the same general proportions. My initial impression is ONE scribe at different speeds, not multiple scribes.

2. **Most visually distinctive feature:** The prevalence of small circular/oval characters. This gives the entire manuscript a visual texture unlike any Latin, Greek, or Arabic hand I've encountered. The script has a "beaded" quality — strings of small round forms with occasional tall vertical interruptions.

3. **Speed registers:** There appear to be at least 3 speed levels:
   - **Careful/formal:** f1r opening paragraph, labels on f77r border
   - **Standard:** Body text on herbal pages (f33v), pharmaceutical paragraphs (f88r)
   - **Rapid:** Dense text on f77r body, f116r throughout

4. **Tall characters as structural markers:** The tall characters (2.5-3x x-height, with looped or capped tops) appear to occur at regular intervals within text. At this distance, they seem to serve as visual rhythm markers — breaking the text into groups. Whether they're individual letters or abbreviation marks is not determinable at 800px.

5. **Labels vs. body text:** Labels near illustrations appear to be in the same hand as body text but written more carefully and at slightly larger size. No obvious hand change.

6. **Ink consistency:** Brown ink throughout for text, with red/colored ink used only for decorative initials (f1r) and illustrations. The brown ink intensity varies slightly between folios (f116r slightly darker), but this could be vellum condition or ink mixing variation.

7. **Something unexpected:** On f77r, the labels along the scalloped top border have a distinctly more careful, "display" quality compared to the body text below. If this is the same scribe, they shifted into a slower register for these labels. This might indicate the labels are functionally different from the body text (headings? proper nouns?).
