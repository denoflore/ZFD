# Speed and Section Comparison

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Method:** Selected one text block (~5 lines) from each of 5 manuscript sections. Measured x-height, ascender height, line spacing, and characterized writing speed from `folios/jpg/VM_f*.jpg` at full resolution.

---

## Block 1: f1r Opening — Paragraph 3 (region ~40,535 to 1060,690)

**Section:** Opening page, body text (the third paragraph, below the first botanical illustration)
**Lines examined:** 5 lines of continuous text

**Measurements (approximate pixel values at native resolution):**
- **x-height** (baseline characters 'o', 'a', 'e'): ~12-14px
- **Ascender height** (gallows characters): ~32-38px above baseline (~2.5-3x x-height)
- **Descender depth** ('y' characters): ~8-10px below baseline
- **Line spacing** (baseline to baseline): ~28-30px
- **Inter-character spacing** (within words): ~4-6px
- **Inter-word spacing**: ~8-12px

**Characterization:**
- **Letter spacing:** MODERATE — clear separation between most characters. Some touching between adjacent round characters ('oo', 'oa').
- **Word spacing:** CLEAR — word boundaries are consistently identifiable by wider gaps.
- **Regularity:** HIGH — consistent x-height, even line spacing, upright characters with minimal lean.
- **Pen pressure:** Even throughout. No obvious thinning or thickening that would indicate speed variation within lines.
- **Notable features:** The red/brown DECORATED INITIALS at paragraph starts are 3-4x the size of body text. These are drawn, not written — they appear to be added separately from the text (possibly later).
- **Speed register:** CAREFUL/FORMAL. This is the most deliberate writing observed. Characters are well-formed, spacing is generous, and there is minimal stroke abbreviation.

## Block 2: f13v Herbal — Body Text (region ~30,130 to 1100,330)

**Section:** Mid-herbal (folio 13 verso), body text below a plant illustration
**Lines examined:** 3 lines of text visible (the rest is illustration)

**Measurements:**
- **x-height:** ~12-13px
- **Ascender height:** ~30-34px (~2.5x x-height)
- **Line spacing:** ~28px
- **Inter-character spacing:** ~3-5px
- **Inter-word spacing:** ~7-10px

**Characterization:**
- **Letter spacing:** MODERATE-TIGHT — slightly tighter than f1r but still clear.
- **Word spacing:** CLEAR — word boundaries identifiable.
- **Regularity:** HIGH — consistent character forms, even spacing.
- **Notable features:** The text shares the page with a plant illustration. Text appears to have been written AFTER the illustration (text wraps around the plant's leaf outlines). The writing accommodates the illustration rather than the illustration accommodating the text.
- **Speed register:** STANDARD. Slightly faster than f1r's careful hand but still well-controlled. Characters are fully formed with no abbreviation.

**Comparison to f1r:** Nearly identical in character forms and proportions. The x-height is marginally smaller (~1px), and inter-character spacing is slightly tighter. The same scribe at a comfortable working speed rather than a display/opening-page speed.

## Block 3: f88r Pharmaceutical — Body Text (region ~200,750 to 1090,1000)

**Section:** Pharmaceutical section, body text paragraph between jar illustrations and plant roots
**Lines examined:** ~5 lines of text

**Measurements:**
- **x-height:** ~11-13px
- **Ascender height:** ~28-34px (~2.5x x-height)
- **Line spacing:** ~26-28px
- **Inter-character spacing:** ~3-5px
- **Inter-word spacing:** ~6-9px

**Characterization:**
- **Letter spacing:** MODERATE — similar to f13v.
- **Word spacing:** MOSTLY CLEAR — occasional words where the boundary is ambiguous (the gap narrows to ~4-5px, overlapping with inter-character spacing).
- **Regularity:** MODERATE-HIGH — slightly less even than herbal pages. Some variation in x-height within a line.
- **Notable features:** The text is squeezed between illustration areas, and lines toward the bottom curve slightly to avoid the plant root illustration below. This spatial constraint may account for the slightly less regular spacing.
- **Speed register:** STANDARD. Very similar to f13v herbal text. No obvious speed difference between pharmaceutical and herbal sections.

**Comparison to herbal:** Character forms are IDENTICAL. I see the same 'o', 'a', 'e' circles, the same gallows forms, the same 'ch'/'sh' compounds. The proportions are the same. If told these text blocks came from the same folio, I would believe it.

## Block 4: f77r Biological — Body Text (region ~30,195 to 1080,420)

**Section:** Biological section, dense paragraph above the nymph/pool illustration
**Lines examined:** ~8 lines of dense text

**Measurements:**
- **x-height:** ~10-12px (SMALLER than herbal/pharmaceutical)
- **Ascender height:** ~26-32px (~2.5x x-height, proportionally same)
- **Line spacing:** ~24-26px (TIGHTER than other sections)
- **Inter-character spacing:** ~2-4px (TIGHTER)
- **Inter-word spacing:** ~5-8px (NARROWER)

**Characterization:**
- **Letter spacing:** TIGHT — characters are packed closer together. More touching between adjacent characters.
- **Word spacing:** SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS — the narrower word gaps (~5-6px) overlap with the wider inter-character gaps (~4px), making some word boundaries uncertain.
- **Regularity:** MODERATE — more variation in character size and spacing within lines. Some characters appear slightly tilted (~5-10 degrees rightward).
- **Notable features:** This is the DENSEST text block observed. The scribe appears to be fitting a large amount of text into a limited space (between the scalloped border labels above and the illustration below). The right side of lines approaches the margin more closely than on other folios.
- **Speed register:** RAPID/COMPRESSED. This is clearly the fastest writing observed. Characters are abbreviated — 'aiin' sequences are written as fluid gestures, gallows loop closures are sometimes incomplete, and the 'ch'/'sh' compounds are more compressed than on herbal pages.

**Comparison to herbal:** Same character repertoire but executed at higher speed. Key differences:
- Characters are ~15% smaller overall
- Spacing is ~30% tighter
- More stroke abbreviation (loops not fully closed, hooks abbreviated)
- More rightward lean to the hand
- MORE DIFFICULT TO READ at this resolution because of the compression

Despite the speed difference, the fundamental character forms are recognizable. This is the SAME SCRIBE writing faster, not a different scribe.

## Block 5: f116r Late Manuscript — Recipe Text (region ~50,55 to 1020,300)

**Section:** Near the end of the manuscript, dense text-only section with star decorations
**Lines examined:** ~8 lines

**Measurements:**
- **x-height:** ~10-12px (similar to f77r)
- **Ascender height:** ~25-30px (~2.5x x-height)
- **Line spacing:** ~24-26px (similar to f77r)
- **Inter-character spacing:** ~2-4px
- **Inter-word spacing:** ~5-8px

**Characterization:**
- **Letter spacing:** TIGHT — similar density to f77r.
- **Word spacing:** SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS — similar to f77r in spacing ambiguity.
- **Regularity:** MODERATE — there is variation but the overall texture is consistent.
- **Notable features:** Star-shaped decorations (drawn as simple asterisks, ~10px across) appear in the left margin and between text sections. These are in the SAME INK as the text, suggesting they were drawn during the same writing session, not added later. The text appears to be organized into short paragraphs or entries (some lines end short of the right margin).
- **Speed register:** SEMI-RAPID. Faster than herbal/pharmaceutical standard but perhaps slightly more controlled than f77r's most compressed passages. The scribe appears to be writing at a consistent working pace through a large volume of text.
- **Vellum condition:** There is tape/repair along the top edge and a circular damage spot on the right side, suggesting this folio has suffered wear. Some characters near the damage are partially obscured.

**Comparison to f77r:** Very similar in speed and character size. The writing feels slightly more rhythmic and regular — the scribe may be more comfortable or experienced by this point in the manuscript. Character forms are the same repertoire.

## Cross-Section Analysis

### Single Scribe vs. Multiple Scribes

**ASSESSMENT: SINGLE SCRIBE.**

Evidence for single scribe:
1. **Identical character repertoire** across all 5 sections. The same ~18 character types appear in every section (14 baseline + 4 gallows).
2. **Consistent proportions.** The ratio of gallows height to x-height (~2.5x) is maintained across all sections and speeds.
3. **Same idiosyncrasies.** Specific features like the way 'ch' compounds are formed, the rightward lean in rapid hand, and the treatment of 'aiin' sequences are consistent across all sections.
4. **Speed variation follows a continuum.** The differences between sections are best explained by speed/care registers, not by different scribes. Each section's hand falls on a single spectrum from careful (f1r) to rapid (f77r).

Evidence that COULD suggest multiple scribes (but which I believe is better explained by speed registers):
- The f77r biological text is notably smaller and more compressed. In isolation, one might read this as a different hand.
- The f116r text has a slightly different "feel" — more flowing, less staccato. But the character forms are the same.

**Confidence: HIGH** that this is a single scribe. The character-form consistency across all sections is very strong.

### Speed Registers

I identify THREE distinct speed registers:

| Register | Folios | x-height | Line spacing | Char spacing | Word spacing |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Careful/Formal** | f1r (opening) | 12-14px | 28-30px | 4-6px | 8-12px |
| **Standard** | f13v, f88r | 11-13px | 26-28px | 3-5px | 6-10px |
| **Rapid** | f77r, f116r | 10-12px | 24-26px | 2-4px | 5-8px |

The transitions are gradual, not sharp — there is no hard boundary between registers. The scribe's speed appears to be determined by:
1. **Available space** (f77r is compressed to fit between illustrations)
2. **Content type** (the opening page gets more care; dense reference text is faster)
3. **Position in manuscript** (later folios trend slightly faster, possibly indicating scribal fatigue or confidence)

### Labels vs. Body Text

Labels near illustrations appear to be in the **SAME HAND** as body text but at a **CAREFUL register** even when adjacent body text is faster. This is most visible on f77r, where the scalloped-border labels are written more carefully than the dense paragraph below them. The scribe shifts to a display register for labels and back to a working register for body text on the same page.

### Characters That Look Different Across Sections

| Character | Careful Hand | Rapid Hand | Difference |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| 'o' | Perfectly closed circle | Slightly open, may have gap | Closure completeness |
| 'a' | Circle + clear tail | Open curve + abbreviated tail | Tail length |
| 'ch' | Two distinct elements | Merged single form | Ligature fusion |
| Gallows A | Fully closed top loop | Open loop, tilted shaft | Loop closure, lean |
| 'aiin' | Separable components | Single fluid gesture | Fusion degree |
| 'n' | Visible rightward curve | Straight (like 'i') | Curve visibility |

These speed variants are the SAME character forms at different execution speeds. They do not represent different characters or different scribes.
