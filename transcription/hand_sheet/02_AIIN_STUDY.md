# The 'aiin' Question — Ligature Unit or Four Separate Characters?

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Method:** Examined line-level crops at full resolution (~1100x1536px native) from 8 folios spanning herbal, pharmaceutical, biological, and recipe sections. Identified 15 instances of the 'aiin' pattern (circle-with-tail + two short verticals + hooked final stroke) and 5 control instances of component characters appearing independently.

**Resolution limitation:** At ~150 DPI, individual short vertical strokes ('i') are approximately 2-3px wide and 12-14px tall. Pen-lift points between strokes of this size are at or below the resolution limit. Therefore, pen-lift analysis is based on **spacing patterns, stroke continuity, and relative positioning** rather than direct observation of ink gaps at pen-lift points. This is an honest limitation.

## What 'aiin' Looks Like Physically

The sequence I'm examining consists of four component strokes (as described by EVA):
1. **'a'** — A small circle (~6-8px diameter) with a short tail extending rightward or downward-rightward
2. **First 'i'** — A short vertical stroke (~2-3px wide, ~12px tall)
3. **Second 'i'** — Another short vertical stroke, immediately adjacent
4. **'n'** — A short stroke similar to 'i' but with a slight rightward curve or hook at the bottom

The question: Is this sequence executed as a UNIT (one fluid pen movement) or as FOUR SEPARATE characters (with pen lifts between each)?

## 15 'aiin' Instances

### Instance 1: f1r, paragraph 3, line 5 — region approx. (820, 625, 100, 40)
**Context:** Word-final position. The word ends with the 'aiin' sequence after several baseline characters.
**Pen-lift evidence:** The 'a' circle is clearly formed with its tail extending rightward. The transition from the 'a' tail to the first 'i' shows NO visible gap at this resolution — the tail appears to flow directly into the first vertical stroke. The two 'i' strokes are extremely close together (~2px gap), closer than the spacing between other adjacent characters in the same word (~4-6px). The final 'n' is distinguished only by a very slight rightward lean at its base.
**Speed assessment:** The 'aiin' portion appears to be written MORE FLUIDLY than the characters preceding it in the same word. The preceding characters have clear inter-character spacing; the 'aiin' portion is compressed.
**Assessment:** Suggestive of unit execution. The spacing compression is notable.

### Instance 2: f1r, paragraph 3, line 7 — region approx. (660, 660, 100, 40)
**Context:** Word-final position.
**Pen-lift evidence:** Similar pattern. The 'a' tail flows toward the 'ii' strokes. The 'ii' strokes are tightly spaced. The 'n' curves very slightly rightward.
**Speed assessment:** Fluid execution of the 'aiin' portion.
**Assessment:** Consistent with unit execution.

### Instance 3: f33r, line 3 — region approx. (920, 82, 100, 40)
**Context:** Word-final, careful herbal hand.
**Pen-lift evidence:** In the careful hand, the individual strokes are slightly more distinct. The 'a' circle is well-formed and there IS a small gap (~1-2px) between the tail and the first 'i'. The 'ii' strokes are still tightly grouped but each stroke appears more individually defined than in the rapid hand.
**Speed assessment:** The 'aiin' portion is executed at the same care level as the rest of the word.
**Assessment:** In careful hand, the components are MORE SEPARABLE. This is significant — if 'aiin' were a fully fused ligature, one would expect it to remain fused even in careful hand.

### Instance 4: f33r, line 5 — region approx. (780, 138, 100, 40)
**Context:** Word-final, careful hand.
**Pen-lift evidence:** Similar to Instance 3. Individual strokes are discernible. The 'a' is clearly separate from the 'ii' group. The 'ii' themselves are tightly paired.
**Speed assessment:** Careful, deliberate.
**Assessment:** Components partially separable in careful hand.

### Instance 5: f77r, body line 3 — region approx. (500, 250, 100, 35)
**Context:** Word-final, rapid biological section hand.
**Pen-lift evidence:** The entire 'aiin' sequence appears as a single fluid gesture. The 'a' circle is reduced to a quick oval, and the transition into the 'ii' strokes is seamless. The 'ii' strokes appear as a single wavy line rather than two distinct verticals. The 'n' is barely distinguishable.
**Speed assessment:** This is the FASTEST execution observed. The 'aiin' is clearly written as one movement.
**Assessment:** Strong evidence for unit execution in rapid hand.

### Instance 6: f77r, body line 5 — region approx. (850, 300, 100, 35)
**Context:** Word-final, rapid hand.
**Pen-lift evidence:** Same as Instance 5 — the sequence reads as a single fluid gesture. The internal structure (a+i+i+n) is barely visible; what's visible is a connected sequence of curves and verticals.
**Speed assessment:** Rapid, fluid.
**Assessment:** Unit execution.

### Instance 7: f77r, body line 7 — region approx. (280, 350, 100, 35)
**Context:** Word-final, rapid hand.
**Pen-lift evidence:** Fluid sequence. The 'ii' portion is a wavy vertical stroke.
**Speed assessment:** Rapid.
**Assessment:** Unit execution.

### Instance 8: f88r, bottom paragraph line 2 — region approx. (650, 1110, 100, 40)
**Context:** Word-final, pharmaceutical moderate hand.
**Pen-lift evidence:** The 'a' circle is well-formed. The transition to 'ii' shows a slight spacing gap, but the 'ii+n' portion is tightly grouped. The 'ii' strokes are closer to each other (~2px) than to the preceding 'a' (~3-4px).
**Speed assessment:** Moderate pace. The 'aiin' is executed slightly faster than the word-initial characters.
**Assessment:** Partially fused — the 'iin' portion appears more unified than the 'a' is with 'iin'.

### Instance 9: f88r, bottom paragraph line 4 — region approx. (380, 1160, 100, 40)
**Context:** Word-final, pharmaceutical text.
**Pen-lift evidence:** Similar to Instance 8. The 'a' has a slight gap before 'iin'. The 'iin' is tightly grouped.
**Speed assessment:** Moderate.
**Assessment:** Partially fused 'iin' sub-unit with 'a' slightly separate.

### Instance 10: f116r, body line 3 — region approx. (800, 115, 100, 35)
**Context:** Word-final, late manuscript hand.
**Pen-lift evidence:** The smaller hand on f116r makes individual strokes harder to resolve. The 'aiin' sequence appears as a tight cluster at the word end. The 'a' circle is small (~5px) and runs directly into the 'ii' strokes.
**Speed assessment:** Semi-rapid. The 'aiin' is written as a continuous movement.
**Assessment:** Unit execution likely.

### Instance 11: f116r, body line 5 — region approx. (450, 168, 100, 35)
**Context:** Word-final.
**Pen-lift evidence:** Same tight clustering as Instance 10. Hard to resolve individual components at this resolution with this hand size.
**Speed assessment:** Semi-rapid.
**Assessment:** Unit execution likely.

### Instance 12: f4r, text block line 1 — region approx. (750, 150, 100, 40)
**Context:** Word-final, herbal standard hand.
**Pen-lift evidence:** Clear 'a' circle. The 'iin' portion follows with tight spacing. The 'ii' strokes are closer to each other than to 'a'.
**Speed assessment:** Standard pace.
**Assessment:** Partially fused 'iin' sub-unit.

### Instance 13: f25r, text block line 2 — region approx. (620, 150, 100, 40)
**Context:** Word-final, herbal standard hand.
**Pen-lift evidence:** Standard pattern — 'a' circle, then tightly-grouped 'iin'. The overall sequence takes up slightly less horizontal space than four fully-independent characters would.
**Speed assessment:** Standard.
**Assessment:** Compressed sequence, suggestive of partial fusion.

### Instance 14: f50r, text block line 3 — region approx. (400, 175, 100, 40)
**Context:** Word-final, herbal text.
**Pen-lift evidence:** Clear 'a' followed by tight 'iin' cluster. The 'n' has a visible rightward curve at its base.
**Speed assessment:** Standard.
**Assessment:** Partially fused.

### Instance 15: f105r, text block line 2 — region approx. (500, 100, 100, 40)
**Context:** Word-final, recipe/pharmaceutical text.
**Pen-lift evidence:** Standard 'aiin' pattern. The 'a' is slightly separated from 'iin'. The 'iin' strokes are very tightly grouped.
**Speed assessment:** Moderate.
**Assessment:** Partially fused.

## 5 Control Instances — Component Characters Outside 'aiin'

### Control 1: Isolated 'a' (circle-with-tail) — f33r, line 3, word-medial
**Context:** An 'a' character appearing mid-word, NOT followed by 'ii' strokes.
**Observation:** The circle is the same size as in the 'aiin' instances. The tail extends rightward and clearly terminates before the next character (which is NOT a vertical stroke — it's a different character type). There IS a visible gap between the 'a' tail and the following character.
**Comparison to 'aiin':** The gap after 'a' in this isolated case is WIDER (~5-6px) than the gap between 'a' and 'ii' in 'aiin' instances (~2-4px). This spacing difference is consistent across multiple observations.

### Control 2: Isolated 'i' strokes — f77r, body line 4, word-initial
**Context:** A single short vertical stroke at word-initial position, followed by non-vertical characters.
**Observation:** The stroke is the same height and width as the 'i' strokes within 'aiin' sequences. Its spacing from the following character (~5-6px) is noticeably wider than the inter-'i' spacing within 'aiin' (~2px).
**Comparison:** The 'i' outside of 'aiin' has more generous spacing from neighbors.

### Control 3: Two consecutive 'i' strokes NOT in 'aiin' — f88r, body text
**Context:** A pair of short vertical strokes appearing mid-word without preceding 'a' or following 'n'.
**Observation:** The two strokes are spaced at approximately ~3px apart — tighter than general inter-character spacing but possibly slightly wider than the ~2px observed in 'aiin' instances. However, this difference is at the limit of measurement precision at this resolution.
**Comparison:** The spacing is similar to 'ii' within 'aiin', suggesting that adjacent vertical strokes tend to be tightly grouped regardless of context.

### Control 4: 'n'-like terminal stroke in non-aiin context — f33r, line 4
**Context:** A word ending with a single hooked stroke (possible 'n') NOT preceded by 'ii'.
**Observation:** The stroke looks identical to the final 'n' stroke in 'aiin' sequences — same height, same slight rightward curve at base.
**Comparison:** Visually indistinguishable from 'n' within 'aiin' at this resolution.

### Control 5: 'a' followed by non-'i' character — f1r, paragraph 3
**Context:** An 'a' (circle-with-tail) followed by a round character (another circle), not followed by vertical strokes.
**Observation:** The 'a' tail extends rightward and clearly terminates with a gap before the following circle. The gap is ~5px.
**Comparison:** The 'a' is the same character in all contexts, but the gap after it is wider when NOT followed by 'i' strokes.

## Analysis

### Key Findings

**1. Spacing compression is real.** The spacing between components within 'aiin' (~2-3px between strokes) is consistently tighter than the spacing between the same component characters when they appear independently (~5-6px). This is the strongest physical evidence that 'aiin' is executed differently from four separate characters.

**2. Speed register affects fusion.** In rapid hand (f77r), 'aiin' appears as a single fluid gesture where internal components are barely distinguishable. In careful hand (f33r), the components are more individually defined. This is a spectrum, not a binary:
- **Rapid hand:** Fully fused unit (single pen movement apparent)
- **Standard hand:** Partially fused ('a' slightly separated, 'iin' tightly grouped)
- **Careful hand:** Components more separable but still compressed

**3. 'iin' appears to be a SUB-UNIT.** Across all speed registers, the 'iin' portion is more tightly grouped than the 'a+iin' junction. This suggests a two-level structure: 'a' + 'iin' rather than 'a+i+i+n'. The 'iin' sub-unit behaves like a ligature even when 'a' maintains slight separation from it.

**4. The 'n' is barely distinguishable from a third 'i'.** In most instances, the difference between the final 'n' stroke and the preceding 'i' strokes is a very slight rightward lean or curve at the base of 'n'. At this resolution (~150 DPI), I cannot reliably distinguish 'n' from 'i' in all cases. POSITION (word-final) may be the primary factor in reading a stroke as 'n' rather than 'i'. This is an important ambiguity — it means the 'n' identity may be partly CONTEXTUAL rather than purely FORMAL.

**5. Control comparisons confirm spacing difference.** Isolated 'a' has wider post-character gaps. Isolated 'i' has wider inter-character gaps. The same characters within 'aiin' are consistently more compressed.

### Conclusion

**'aiin' is NEITHER fully four separate characters NOR a completely fused single ligature.** The physical evidence shows:

- It is executed with **compressed spacing** that distinguishes it from four independently-written characters
- In rapid hand it **approaches full fusion** (single pen movement)
- In careful hand the **components remain partially separable**
- The strongest sub-grouping is **'iin'** which behaves as a tight unit
- The overall structure is best described as **'a' + 'iin' (sub-ligature)** with the degree of fusion varying by speed register

This is consistent with the ZFD reading of 'aiin' as a suffix unit '-ain', but the physical evidence shows it as a **partially-fused sequence** rather than a fully opaque ligature. The scribe appears to know it as a chunk (writing it faster and more compressed than surrounding text) but still constructs it from recognizable component strokes.

### What Cannot Be Determined at This Resolution

- Exact pen-lift points (below resolution limit)
- Whether the 'a' circle and its tail are one stroke or two
- Whether the 'ii' wavy line in rapid hand is truly one stroke or two with invisible pen lifts
- Whether the 'n' vs 'i' distinction is formal (shape) or positional (word-final context)
