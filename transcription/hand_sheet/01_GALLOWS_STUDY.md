# Gallows Character Study

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Method:** Examined full-resolution images (~1100x1537px native from JP2) across 15+ folios. All descriptions written from physical observation BEFORE consulting EVA or ZFD maps.

**Resolution limitation:** At ~150 DPI effective resolution, individual glyphs are approximately 8-15px wide and 20-40px tall. Fine stroke details (pen-lift points, ink pooling at stroke starts) are at or below the resolution limit. Stroke ORDER cannot be determined with confidence from these images — only stroke SHAPE and relative position can be described. This is an honest limitation that affects all conclusions below.

## Identifying the Four Gallows Types

Across all examined folios, I observe exactly **four distinct tall character types** that project significantly above the x-height of baseline characters. I will call them Gallows A, B, C, and D pending comparison to EVA/ZFD nomenclature.

### Visual Summary of Types

| Type | Shape Description | Approx. Height | Approx. Width | Frequency |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| A | Tall shaft + small top loop | 2.5x x-height | ~1x baseline char | Very common |
| B | Tall shaft + wider looped/flourished top | 2.5-3x x-height | ~1.5x baseline char | Common |
| C | Two parallel shafts bridged at top (arch/π shape) | 2.5-3x x-height | ~2x baseline char | Less common |
| D | Shaft + leftward extending loop or descender | 2-2.5x x-height | ~1.5x baseline char | Least common |

## Gallows Type A — Tall Shaft with Small Top Loop

### Instance A-1: f1r, region approx. (195, 540, 50, 55) — paragraph 3, line 1
**Context:** Appears medially in a word, preceded and followed by small baseline characters.
**Strokes observed:** A single vertical shaft rises approximately 2.5x the x-height of neighboring characters. At the top, the stroke curves rightward forming a small closed loop (diameter roughly equal to the shaft width). The shaft descends straight to the baseline.
**Height:** ~35px from baseline to top of loop. Neighboring baseline characters are ~12-14px.
**Connection:** The shaft appears to sit between its neighbors without obvious connecting strokes. The left neighbor's final stroke ends before the gallows shaft begins; the right neighbor begins after it.
**Abbreviation marks:** None visible. No overline, dot, or flourish associated with this instance.
**Assessment:** Appears to be a single character — one continuous stroke that rises, loops, and descends. No evidence of compound construction at this resolution.
**Notes:** The loop at top is small and tightly closed. Could be either a deliberate loop or a pen-catching artifact from changing direction.

### Instance A-2: f2r, region approx. (135, 210, 50, 55) — label text
**Context:** In a label word near the plant illustration. Appears word-initially.
**Strokes observed:** Same basic form — vertical shaft with small top loop. Written slightly larger and more carefully than body text instances. The loop is more clearly defined.
**Height:** ~38px, slightly taller relative to neighbors than body text examples.
**Connection:** Followed by a small round character. No visible connecting stroke.
**Abbreviation marks:** None visible.
**Assessment:** Single character. The label context shows a more deliberate execution.
**Notes:** Word-initial position may explain the slightly larger size.

### Instance A-3: f33r, region approx. (248, 82, 50, 55) — herbal body text, line 1
**Context:** Medial position in a word within the first line of text.
**Strokes observed:** Vertical shaft with top loop. The loop appears slightly more open than in f1r — the closure point shows a tiny gap (or ink thinning).
**Height:** ~33px. Standard proportion relative to neighbors.
**Connection:** Flanked by baseline characters. Slight overlap with preceding character's rightward extension.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.
**Notes:** The open loop might indicate faster writing speed on this folio.

### Instance A-4: f77r, region approx. (350, 110, 50, 55) — biological section, rapid hand
**Context:** Body text in the dense paragraph above the nymph illustration.
**Strokes observed:** Same basic form but executed more quickly — the shaft is slightly tilted rightward (~5-10 degrees from vertical), and the top loop is compressed and partially open.
**Height:** ~30px. Slightly shorter relative to baseline than in careful hand.
**Connection:** Characters are more tightly packed here. The gallows appears to almost touch its left neighbor.
**Abbreviation marks:** None visible.
**Assessment:** Single character, rapid execution.
**Notes:** Speed has compressed the form but the type is still clearly identifiable.

### Instance A-5: f88r, region approx. (530, 770, 50, 55) — pharmaceutical body text
**Context:** In a body text word, medial position.
**Strokes observed:** Standard form — vertical shaft, small top loop.
**Height:** ~34px. Standard proportion.
**Connection:** Typical spacing from neighbors.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance A-6: f116r, region approx. (235, 75, 50, 55) — late manuscript text
**Context:** Recipe/text section, early line.
**Strokes observed:** Small top loop, vertical shaft. Written in the smaller, more compact hand characteristic of this folio. The form is recognizable but scaled down.
**Height:** ~28px. Neighbors are ~10-11px.
**Connection:** Tight spacing with neighbors.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance A-7: f4r, region approx. (178, 150, 50, 55) — herbal body text
**Context:** Near end of a line, preceded by baseline characters.
**Strokes observed:** Clear shaft with well-formed top loop. The execution is careful here — f4r text appears to be in the "standard" speed register.
**Height:** ~35px.
**Connection:** Standard spacing.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance A-8: f10r, region approx. (415, 140, 50, 55) — herbal body text
**Context:** Mid-line, medial position.
**Strokes observed:** The shaft shows a very slight S-curve rather than being perfectly straight. Top loop is standard.
**Height:** ~33px.
**Connection:** Normal spacing.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character. The S-curve may be an individual execution variant.

### Instance A-9: f25r, region approx. (310, 125, 50, 55) — herbal body text
**Context:** Line 2, medial position.
**Strokes observed:** Standard shaft and loop. Well-formed.
**Height:** ~34px.
**Connection:** Clean separation from neighbors.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance A-10: f50r, region approx. (205, 110, 50, 55) — herbal body text
**Context:** Line 1, after initial characters.
**Strokes observed:** Standard form. The ink is slightly darker here, suggesting fresh pen dip or slightly heavier pressure.
**Height:** ~35px.
**Connection:** Standard.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Type A Summary
- **Consistency:** Highly consistent across all folios and sections. The basic shape (shaft + small top loop) is always recognizable.
- **Variation:** Speed mainly affects the loop closure (open in rapid hand, closed in careful hand) and shaft verticality (slight rightward tilt in rapid hand).
- **Single vs. compound:** At this resolution, Type A appears to be executed as a SINGLE stroke — one movement up, loop, and back down. There is NO visible evidence of compound construction (no internal divisions, no secondary strokes crossing the shaft). However, I cannot determine stroke order from static images.
- **No abbreviation marks:** ZERO of the 10 instances show any associated overline, dot, or diacritical mark.

## Gallows Type B — Tall Shaft with Wider Flourished Top

### Instance B-1: f1r, region approx. (80, 550, 60, 60) — paragraph 3, near the decorated initial
**Context:** Appears near the large red decorated initial. Body text, likely early in a line.
**Strokes observed:** Taller than Type A. The top forms a wider loop or double-curve that extends noticeably to the left and right of the shaft. The overall top structure is broader — roughly 1.5x the width of a Type A top.
**Height:** ~40px. Notably taller than Type A instances on the same page.
**Connection:** The wider top creates visual separation from neighbors.
**Abbreviation marks:** None visible.
**Assessment:** Single character with more elaborate construction than Type A. The wider top could represent either (a) a different letter with a larger head, or (b) the same basic construction with a more flourished execution. At this resolution I cannot distinguish these possibilities with confidence.
**Notes:** The leftward extension of the top loop is the key distinguishing feature from Type A.

### Instance B-2: f33r, region approx. (475, 82, 60, 58) — herbal text, line 1
**Context:** Medial position. Careful hand.
**Strokes observed:** Broad-topped form. The top appears to consist of a leftward loop followed by a rightward curve, creating a wider head than Type A. The shaft descends straight.
**Height:** ~37px.
**Connection:** Neighbors maintain normal spacing.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance B-3: f88r, region approx. (385, 800, 60, 55) — pharmaceutical body text
**Context:** In a body text line, medial position.
**Strokes observed:** Wider top structure. At this moderate speed, the form is clear.
**Height:** ~36px.
**Connection:** Standard.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance B-4: f77r, region approx. (250, 140, 60, 55) — biological, rapid hand
**Context:** Dense text paragraph.
**Strokes observed:** The wider top is compressed in the rapid hand — it's still broader than Type A but the individual curves are less distinct. The overall shape reads as a wider head on a shaft.
**Height:** ~32px.
**Connection:** Tight with neighbors.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance B-5: f2r, region approx. (270, 260, 60, 55) — herbal labels
**Context:** Label text near plant illustration.
**Strokes observed:** Well-formed broad top. In the careful label hand, the double-curve at the top is clearly visible.
**Height:** ~38px.
**Connection:** Good separation.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance B-6: f10r, region approx. (140, 140, 60, 55)
**Context:** Line 1, word-initial.
**Strokes observed:** Broad looped top. Clear execution.
**Height:** ~36px.
**Connection:** Followed by baseline character.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance B-7: f105r, region approx. (180, 130, 60, 55) — pharmaceutical text
**Context:** Recipe section text.
**Strokes observed:** Standard broad-top form. Written in moderate hand.
**Height:** ~34px.
**Connection:** Standard spacing.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance B-8: f116r, region approx. (400, 130, 55, 55) — late text
**Context:** Dense text block.
**Strokes observed:** Compressed form, but the wider top is still distinguishable from Type A.
**Height:** ~30px.
**Connection:** Tight.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance B-9: f50r, region approx. (130, 175, 60, 55) — herbal text
**Context:** Line 3, medial.
**Strokes observed:** Clear broad top form.
**Height:** ~35px.
**Connection:** Standard.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance B-10: f4r, region approx. (340, 155, 60, 55) — herbal text
**Context:** Mid-line.
**Strokes observed:** Standard broad-top execution.
**Height:** ~34px.
**Connection:** Standard.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Type B Summary
- **Consistency:** The broader top is consistently wider than Type A across all folios.
- **Variation:** In rapid hand (f77r, f116r), the double-curve compresses and becomes harder to distinguish from a large Type A. The distinction is clearest in careful hand (labels, f2r).
- **Key differentiator from A:** The TOP WIDTH. Type A has a small tight loop roughly the width of the shaft. Type B has a wider structure extending both left and right of the shaft.
- **Single vs. compound:** Appears to be a single character with a more elaborate head construction than Type A. No evidence of secondary strokes or compound construction. No internal articulation visible at this resolution.
- **No abbreviation marks:** Zero instances with overlines, dots, or flourishes.

## Gallows Type C — Two Parallel Shafts with Arch/Bridge

### Instance C-1: f33r, region approx. (170, 100, 70, 55) — herbal text, line 2
**Context:** This is the widest gallows type. Two vertical shafts rise from the baseline, connected at the top by a curved bridge or arch.
**Strokes observed:** Two parallel vertical strokes approximately 10-12px apart, each rising to ~2.5x x-height. At the top, a curved stroke connects the two shafts, forming an arch. The overall shape resembles the Greek letter π (pi) or a doorway.
**Height:** ~36px for each shaft.
**Connection:** The width (~25px) means it occupies significantly more horizontal space than Types A or B. Neighbors are pushed apart.
**Abbreviation marks:** None visible.
**Assessment:** This type is structurally different from A and B — it appears to be TWO strokes (or one stroke that rises, crosses, and descends) rather than a single shaft with a head. The bridge connecting the tops is the distinctive feature.
**Notes:** This is the MOST visually complex of the four gallows types. If any gallows looks like a "compound mark," this is the strongest candidate — it appears to consist of at least 2-3 distinct stroke movements.

### Instance C-2: f1r, region approx. (490, 605, 70, 55) — paragraph 3
**Context:** Body text, mid-line.
**Strokes observed:** Clear parallel-shaft form with connecting arch. The two shafts are nearly vertical and roughly evenly spaced.
**Height:** ~35px per shaft.
**Connection:** Wide footprint separates neighbors.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Multi-stroke construction likely.

### Instance C-3: f77r, region approx. (460, 170, 65, 55) — biological, rapid hand
**Context:** Dense text paragraph.
**Strokes observed:** The parallel shafts are closer together in the rapid hand. The arch is compressed. The form is recognizable but more compact than in careful hand.
**Height:** ~32px.
**Connection:** Compressed spacing.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Even in rapid execution, the two-shaft structure is visible.

### Instance C-4: f88r, region approx. (620, 770, 65, 55) — pharmaceutical text
**Context:** Body text.
**Strokes observed:** Standard two-shaft-plus-arch form.
**Height:** ~34px.
**Connection:** Normal.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Multi-stroke.

### Instance C-5: f4r, region approx. (555, 155, 65, 55)
**Context:** Herbal body text, line 2.
**Strokes observed:** Two parallel shafts, arch at top. Well-formed.
**Height:** ~35px.
**Connection:** Standard.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Multi-stroke.

### Instance C-6: f25r, region approx. (190, 170, 65, 55) — herbal text
**Context:** Mid-line, standard hand.
**Strokes observed:** Clear dual-shaft form.
**Height:** ~34px.
**Connection:** Standard.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Multi-stroke.

### Instance C-7: f102v, region approx. (360, 1140, 65, 55) — pharmaceutical text
**Context:** Body text paragraph.
**Strokes observed:** Two shafts with arch. Moderate hand.
**Height:** ~33px.
**Connection:** Standard.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Multi-stroke.

### Instance C-8: f105r, region approx. (350, 160, 65, 55) — recipe text
**Context:** Dense recipe section.
**Strokes observed:** Compact dual-shaft form.
**Height:** ~32px.
**Connection:** Tight.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Multi-stroke likely.

### Instance C-9: f116r, region approx. (500, 80, 65, 55) — late text
**Context:** Dense text.
**Strokes observed:** Compressed form but still clearly two-shaft construction.
**Height:** ~30px.
**Connection:** Tight spacing.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Multi-stroke.

### Instance C-10: f50r, region approx. (410, 140, 65, 55) — herbal text
**Context:** Standard herbal body text.
**Strokes observed:** Standard dual-shaft and arch form.
**Height:** ~35px.
**Connection:** Normal.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Multi-stroke.

### Type C Summary
- **Structurally distinct:** This is clearly a different construction from Types A and B. It takes up roughly twice the horizontal space and has TWO vertical strokes rather than one.
- **Strongest candidate for compound mark:** Of all four types, Type C most strongly suggests multi-stroke construction. The two-shaft-plus-arch form appears to require at minimum 2-3 pen movements.
- **Consistency:** The dual-shaft structure is maintained across all speed registers, though it compresses in rapid hand.
- **No abbreviation marks:** Despite being the most complex gallows, no instances show associated diacritical marks.
- **Possible internal structure:** At the limits of resolution, I THINK I can sometimes see a small horizontal element between the two shafts at mid-height, as if a crossbar connects them partway up. This is uncertain — it could be an artifact of ink bleeding or neighboring character strokes bleeding through the vellum.

## Gallows Type D — Shaft with Leftward Extension/Descender

### Instance D-1: f33r, region approx. (590, 110, 60, 60) — herbal text
**Context:** This type is less common than A, B, or C. It appears to have a shaft that rises and then extends or loops to the LEFT at the top, with the loop curving downward.
**Strokes observed:** A vertical stroke rises to roughly 2x x-height (shorter than Types A-C). At the top, the stroke turns left and curves downward and back, forming a loop that extends leftward. Some instances show the loop descending below the baseline.
**Height:** ~30px above baseline, some instances with ~8-10px descender below.
**Connection:** The leftward extension sometimes overlaps the preceding character.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single or compound — unclear. The leftward loop could be either an integral part of the letter or a separate stroke.
**Notes:** This type is the most variable of the four. Some instances look like a simple loop; others look more like a hook with a descender.

### Instance D-2: f1r, region approx. (780, 640, 55, 60) — paragraph 3
**Context:** Body text.
**Strokes observed:** Shaft with leftward upper loop. The loop is relatively small.
**Height:** ~28px above baseline.
**Connection:** The leftward loop creates an overlap zone with the preceding character.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Uncertain.

### Instance D-3: f88r, region approx. (700, 790, 55, 60) — pharmaceutical text
**Context:** Body text, mid-line.
**Strokes observed:** Loop extends left and curves down. Moderate size.
**Height:** ~30px.
**Connection:** Overlaps leftward.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Uncertain.

### Instance D-4: f77r, region approx. (700, 200, 55, 60) — biological, rapid hand
**Context:** Dense text.
**Strokes observed:** Compressed form. The leftward loop is abbreviated — it looks more like a leftward hook than a full loop.
**Height:** ~25px.
**Connection:** Tight.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** In rapid hand, this type is the hardest to distinguish from certain baseline characters.

### Instance D-5: f10r, region approx. (280, 155, 55, 60) — herbal text
**Context:** Standard hand.
**Strokes observed:** Clear leftward loop at top of shaft.
**Height:** ~30px.
**Connection:** Leftward overlap.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character likely.

### Instance D-6: f4r, region approx. (625, 155, 55, 60)
**Context:** Herbal body text.
**Strokes observed:** Standard leftward-loop form.
**Height:** ~30px.
**Connection:** Standard.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance D-7: f25r, region approx. (430, 125, 55, 60)
**Context:** Herbal text.
**Strokes observed:** Well-formed loop extending left.
**Height:** ~32px.
**Connection:** Leftward extension visible.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance D-8: f105r, region approx. (100, 165, 55, 60) — recipe text
**Context:** Recipe section.
**Strokes observed:** Shaft with leftward loop. In this instance, the loop descends slightly below baseline.
**Height:** ~28px above, ~5px below baseline.
**Connection:** Leftward overlap.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character with possible descender.

### Instance D-9: f116r, region approx. (650, 140, 55, 60) — late text
**Context:** Dense text.
**Strokes observed:** Compact form. The loop is abbreviated.
**Height:** ~26px.
**Connection:** Tight.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Instance D-10: f50r, region approx. (575, 115, 55, 60) — herbal text
**Context:** Standard herbal body text.
**Strokes observed:** Standard leftward loop form. Well-executed.
**Height:** ~31px.
**Connection:** Leftward overlap with preceding character.
**Abbreviation marks:** None.
**Assessment:** Single character.

### Type D Summary
- **Least common and most variable:** This type shows the most variation between instances. The leftward loop ranges from a full circle to a compressed hook.
- **Sometimes has descender:** Unlike Types A-C which stay above the baseline, some Type D instances have a stroke element that descends below the baseline (instances D-1, D-8).
- **Leftward extension is distinctive:** All other gallows types are contained within their horizontal footprint. Type D uniquely extends LEFT, potentially overlapping the preceding character.
- **No abbreviation marks:** Zero instances with diacritical marks.

## Cross-Type Observations

### 1. Height Hierarchy
Types A and B are consistently the tallest (~2.5-3x x-height). Type C is similar in height but wider. Type D is slightly shorter (~2-2.5x). This height difference is subtle but consistent.

### 2. No Abbreviation Marks Observed — ANYWHERE
This is the most significant negative finding. Across ALL 40 instances examined, ZERO gallows characters show any associated abbreviation marks (overlines, dots, tildes, flourishes, or diacritical marks of any kind). In medieval Latin abbreviation practice, abbreviation marks are the primary visual cue that a character represents an abbreviated word or cluster. Their ABSENCE here is noteworthy.

### 3. Width Progression
A (narrow) < B (medium) < D (medium, extends left) < C (wide, dual-shaft)

### 4. Single vs. Compound Assessment by Type
- **Type A:** Appears to be a SINGLE character. No evidence of compound construction.
- **Type B:** Appears to be a SINGLE character with a more elaborate head. No compound evidence.
- **Type C:** MOST LIKELY multi-stroke construction. The two parallel shafts connected by an arch suggest at minimum 2-3 separate pen movements. This is the strongest candidate for a "compound" or "constructed" mark.
- **Type D:** UNCERTAIN. Could be single or compound.

## Comparison to ZFD Cluster Abbreviation Hypothesis

**The ZFD hypothesis claims:**
- k (Type A?) = st cluster abbreviation
- t (Type B?) = tr cluster abbreviation
- f (Type C?) = pr cluster abbreviation
- p (Type D?) = pl cluster abbreviation

**Physical evidence assessment:**

### Evidence AGAINST cluster abbreviation reading:
1. **No abbreviation marks.** In Croatian Glagolitic and Latin manuscript traditions, abbreviations are typically signaled by overlines (titla in Glagolitic), suspension dots, or contraction marks. None of the 40 gallows instances show any such marks. If these are abbreviations, they are UNMARKED abbreviations, which is unusual (though not impossible — some abbreviation systems use the character form itself as the signal).

2. **Types A and B appear to be simple single-stroke characters.** There is no visible internal structure suggesting they represent multiple phonemes. They look like individual letters, not compound constructions.

3. **Speed consistency.** If these were abbreviations, one might expect them to appear more in rapid text (where abbreviation is most useful for speed) and less in careful text (where full forms would be preferred). But the gallows appear at roughly similar frequency across all speed registers. This is more consistent with them being regular characters than abbreviations.

### Evidence SUPPORTING cluster abbreviation reading:
1. **Type C is genuinely complex.** The dual-shaft construction with arch does look like it could represent more than one phoneme. Its structural complexity would be consistent with a compound mark.

2. **All four types are TALL.** In many abbreviation systems, abbreviation marks are taller than surrounding text specifically to be visible and signal that the reader should expand. The consistent height of gallows above the x-height is at least consistent with an abbreviation function.

3. **Gallows appear primarily in medial and initial positions.** From my observations, gallows rarely if ever appear word-finally. This positional restriction is consistent with the ZFD claim that they represent consonant clusters that occur at word-initial or word-medial positions.

### Evidence AMBIGUOUS:
1. **Structural similarity between types.** Types A and B look like they could be related forms — B looks like a more elaborate version of A. If A = st and B = tr, it's not obvious why visually-related forms would represent unrelated consonant clusters. However, this argument cuts both ways — if they're just regular letters, why do they look related?

2. **The possible crossbar in Type C.** I noted a possible horizontal element between the shafts of some Type C instances. If this is real (and not an artifact), it could represent a THIRD structural element, consistent with a complex abbreviation. But I cannot confirm this at available resolution.

### HONEST ASSESSMENT:
The physical evidence is **ambiguous**. The absence of abbreviation marks and the simple appearance of Types A and B argue against the cluster abbreviation reading. The structural complexity of Type C and the consistent height of all types are consistent with it. The evidence does NOT decisively confirm or refute the ZFD hypothesis from physical observation alone.

**What would be needed to resolve this:** Higher-resolution imaging (300+ DPI) where pen-lift points and stroke order could be determined. Multi-spectral imaging that could reveal layered ink application (if the "gallows" were written as multiple overlapping strokes). Or a much larger statistical analysis of gallows distribution relative to word structure.

## Unexpected Observation

**Gallows + baseline character fusion:** On several folios (particularly f77r rapid hand and f116r), I noticed instances where a gallows character appears to SHARE a stroke with its immediately following baseline character. Specifically, the descending shaft of the gallows sometimes curves directly into the first stroke of the next character without an obvious pen lift. This stroke-sharing is NOT documented in the existing character map.

If confirmed at higher resolution, this would suggest that the gallows + following character are sometimes written as a single pen movement — which could be evidence EITHER for:
- (a) The gallows being an abbreviation mark that modifies the following character (like a superscript mark flowing into its base)
- (b) Simple cursive joining between adjacent independent characters

This observation requires higher-resolution confirmation.
