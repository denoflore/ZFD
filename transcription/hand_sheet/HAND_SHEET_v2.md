## 1. Scribal Profile

### 1.1 Number of Scribes
**ONE scribe** throughout all examined sections (herbal, pharmaceutical, biological, zodiac labels, recipe text). Evidence: identical character repertoire (~18 types), consistent gallows-to-x-height ratio (~2.5x), same idiosyncratic character forms across all sections. Variation between sections is best explained by speed registers, not different hands.

### 1.2 Speed Registers
Three registers identified:

| Register | Characterized by | Found on |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| **Careful/Formal** | Large x-height (12-14px), generous spacing, fully-formed characters, complete loop closures | f1r opening paragraph, labels on diagram pages |
| **Standard** | Moderate x-height (11-13px), moderate spacing, well-formed characters with minor abbreviation | Herbal body text (f13v, f33r), pharmaceutical body text (f88r) |
| **Rapid/Compressed** | Small x-height (10-12px), tight spacing, abbreviated strokes, loops sometimes open, 'aiin' fused into single gesture | f77r biological, f116r recipe text |

### 1.3 Writing Direction and Lean
Left-to-right. Characters are predominantly upright in careful/standard registers. Slight rightward lean (~5-10 degrees) in rapid register.

### 1.4 Pen
Consistent brown ink throughout (with red/colored ink for decoration only). Pen appears to be a cut quill producing a relatively uniform stroke width (~2px at this resolution). No obvious evidence of a broad-nib that would produce thick/thin variation.

### 1.5 Text-Illustration Relationship
Text wraps AROUND illustrations, indicating illustrations were drawn first and text was fitted into remaining space. Labels appear in the same hand as body text but at careful register.

## 2. Character Inventory

### 2.1 Baseline Characters (14 types)

| # | Physical Description | EVA | Positional Behavior | Distinguishability |
|---|---------------------|-----|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | Small closed circle, ~7px diameter | 'o' | All positions; common initial | Highly distinct |
| 2 | Circle with rightward tail, ~12px total | 'a' | All positions; common medial | Distinct in careful hand; ambiguous with 'o' in rapid |
| 3 | Right-opening crescent (C-shape), ~7px | 'e' | All positions; common medial | Distinct (open vs. closed discriminates from 'o') |
| 4 | Short vertical stroke, ~12px tall | 'i' | All positions; extremely common medial | AMBIGUOUS with 'n', 'r', 'l' |
| 5 | Stroke with below-baseline descender, ~22px | 'y' | Strongly word-final | Highly distinct (only common descender) |
| 6 | Crescent + tall stroke compound, ~16px wide | 'ch' | Primarily word-initial | Distinct in careful hand; ambiguous with 'sh' in rapid |
| 7 | Complex curve + tall stroke compound, ~18px | 'sh' | Primarily word-initial | Ambiguous with 'ch' in rapid hand |
| 8 | Large sweeping curve, ~15px | 'q' | EXCLUSIVELY word-initial | Most distinctive character in inventory |
| 9 | Loop-on-shaft, ~20px tall | 'd' | Initial and medial | Distinct (loop structure unique) |
| 10 | Short stroke with subtle hook, ~12px | 'r' | Medial and final | AMBIGUOUS with 'i' at this resolution |
| 11 | Taller vertical stroke, ~18px | 'l' | Medial and final | AMBIGUOUS with tall 'i' |
| 12 | Short stroke with slight rightward base curve, ~12px | 'n' | STRONGLY word-final | AMBIGUOUS with 'i' (position primary discriminator) |
| 13 | Wider stroke with double-curve base, ~8px wide | 'm' | Word-final; rare | Difficult to distinguish from 'n' in rapid |
| 14 | Leftward-leaning curved stroke, ~14px | 's' | Initial and medial | Relatively distinct (leftward lean visible at most speeds) |

### 2.2 Gallows Characters (4 types)

| # | Physical Description | EVA | Height | Width | Construction |
|---|---------------------|-----|--------|-------|-------------|
| A | Tall shaft + small closed top loop | 'k' | ~2.5x x-height | ~1x baseline char | Appears single-stroke |
| B | Tall shaft + wider flourished/double-looped top | 't' | ~2.5-3x x-height | ~1.5x baseline char | Appears single-stroke |
| C | Two parallel shafts connected by arch at top (π-shape) | 'f' | ~2.5-3x x-height | ~2x baseline char | Multi-stroke likely (2-3 movements) |
| D | Shaft + leftward extending loop, sometimes with descender | 'p' | ~2-2.5x x-height | ~1.5x baseline char | Uncertain (single or compound) |

### 2.3 Compound/Ligature Forms

| Form | Components | Behavior | Evidence for Unit Status |
|------|-----------|----------|--------------------------|
| 'ch' | crescent + tall stroke | Word-initial compound | Two elements in careful hand, fused in rapid |
| 'sh' | complex curve + tall stroke | Word-initial compound | Two elements in careful hand, fused in rapid |
| 'aiin' | circle-tail + 2 verticals + hooked final | Word-final suffix sequence | Compressed spacing; fully fused in rapid hand; 'iin' sub-unit is tightest grouping |

## 3. Key Physical Observations

### 3.1 Gallows Show No Abbreviation Marks
Across 40 gallows instances examined (10 per type, from 15+ folios), ZERO show any associated abbreviation marks (overlines, dots, tildes, flourishes). In medieval abbreviation practice (both Latin and Glagolitic), abbreviation marks are the standard signal that a character represents an abbreviated form. Their absence is noteworthy but not conclusive — some abbreviation systems use the character form itself as the signal.

### 3.2 'aiin' Is a Partially-Fused Sequence
Physical evidence shows 'aiin' is written with compressed spacing relative to four independent characters, with the degree of fusion varying by speed register (fully fused in rapid, partially separable in careful). The internal structure 'a' + 'iin' is more robust than 'ai' + 'in', suggesting 'iin' is the primary sub-unit.

### 3.3 Positional Character Identity
Several characters appear to derive their identity partly from WORD POSITION rather than purely from form:
- 'n' is distinguished from 'i' primarily by word-final position (the base curve is unreliable)
- 'q' appears exclusively word-initially (strongest positional restriction)
- 'ch'/'sh' appear primarily word-initially
- 'y' appears primarily word-finally

This positional dependency is consistent with a shorthand system where the same stroke can have different readings depending on its position within a word.

### 3.4 Gallows-to-Neighbor Stroke Fusion
In rapid hand (f77r, f116r), I observed instances where a gallows character's descending shaft appears to curve directly into the first stroke of the following baseline character, without an obvious pen lift. This stroke-sharing is not documented in the existing character map. If confirmed at higher resolution, it would be evidence that the gallows + following character are sometimes written as a single pen movement.

### 3.5 Single Script, Not Cipher
The writing shows all the characteristics of a functional SCRIPT written by a fluent scribe, not a cipher being laboriously encoded:
- Speed registers (a cipher encoder would maintain constant speed)
- Cursive ligature behavior ('ch', 'sh', 'aiin')
- Consistent abbreviation in rapid hand (a practiced hand abbreviates habitually)
- Labels written more carefully than body text (a fluent scribe shifts registers)

## 4. Comparison to FINAL_CHARACTER_MAP_v1

### 4.1 Agreements

The following claims in the character map are SUPPORTED by physical observation:

1. **Three-layer positional system.** The observed positional restrictions ('q' initial, 'n' final, gallows medial) are consistent with a three-layer system of operators, stems, and suffixes.

2. **Operators word-initial.** 'q', 'ch', 'sh' do appear primarily word-initially in the text. My physical observation confirms this distribution pattern.

3. **'aiin' as a unit.** The map treats 'aiin' as the suffix '-ain'. The physical evidence supports treating 'aiin' as a partially-fused unit, though the degree of fusion varies by speed.

4. **Character sound values.** I CANNOT evaluate sound values from paleographic evidence alone. Sound values require linguistic analysis, which is beyond the scope of physical observation.

5. **Gallows as medial characters.** My observation confirms gallows appear primarily in medial positions within words.

### 4.2 Disagreements

See `DISAGREEMENTS.md` for full details. Key points:

1. **Gallows as "broken ligatures."** The map claims gallows are "broken ligatures" representing consonant clusters. My physical observation found NO abbreviation marks and no internal structure in Types A and B that would indicate compound construction. Type C (the π-shaped gallows) does show multi-stroke construction, but the others do not.

2. **'ch' and 'sh' as single phonemes.** The map assigns 'ch' → /h/ and 'sh' → /š/. My observation shows these are two-component LIGATURES (crescent + tall stroke), not single characters. Whether they represent single phonemes or consonant pairs is a linguistic question, but physically they are compounds.

3. **Confidence in 'i'/'n'/'r'/'l' distinctions.** The map confidently assigns distinct sound values to these characters. My observation finds they are frequently INDISTINGUISHABLE at available resolution. Transcriptions that claim to reliably separate these should note the ambiguity.

### 4.3 New Observations Not in Existing Documentation

1. **Gallows stroke fusion in rapid hand.** Not previously documented.
2. **'iin' as a sub-unit within 'aiin'.** The existing map treats 'aiin' as one unit. My observation suggests a two-level structure: 'a' + 'iin'.
3. **Speed-dependent ambiguity between 'o' and 'a'.** At rapid speeds, ~10% of instances are genuinely ambiguous. This error rate is not acknowledged in the existing transcription.
4. **Labels at careful register while body text is rapid.** The register shift within a single page suggests functional differentiation between labels and body text.
5. **The absence of abbreviation marks on gallows** is not discussed in the map, which claims they are abbreviations.

## 5. Methodology Notes

### 5.1 What This Hand Sheet IS
A description of the physical appearance of the Voynich MS script based on direct observation of manuscript images at ~150 DPI. Character types are identified by physical form and positional behavior. Speed registers are identified by measurement of spacing and character formation quality.

### 5.2 What This Hand Sheet IS NOT
- A decipherment (sound values are not assigned based on physical observation)
- A validation or refutation of the ZFD hypothesis (the physical evidence is ambiguous on key claims)
- A substitute for higher-resolution analysis (many observations are at the resolution limit)

### 5.3 Sources
- Primary: `folios/jpg/VM_f*.jpg` (209 canonical Beinecke JPGs)
- Additional: `folios/jp2/` (JP2 originals, same resolution)
