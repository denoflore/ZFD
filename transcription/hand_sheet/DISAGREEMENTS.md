## Disagreement 1: Gallows as "Broken Ligatures" (Cluster Abbreviations)

**Character map claims:** Gallows are "broken ligatures" from Croatian Glagolitic tradition, representing consonant clusters: k→/st/, t→/tr/, f→/pr/, p→/pl/.

**Physical observation:**
- Gallows Types A (EVA k) and B (EVA t) show NO visible internal structure suggesting compound construction. They appear to be single characters — single strokes with looped or flourished tops.
- Gallows Type C (EVA f) DOES show multi-stroke construction (two parallel shafts + arch). This type IS consistent with a compound or ligature origin.
- Gallows Type D (EVA p) is uncertain — the leftward loop could be either integral or a secondary stroke.
- ZERO of 40 examined gallows instances show abbreviation marks (overlines, dots, tildes) that are standard signals for abbreviation in both Latin and Glagolitic manuscript traditions.

**Assessment:** The physical evidence partially supports the claim for Type C but does NOT support it for Types A and B. The absence of abbreviation marks across ALL types is a significant negative finding. This does not DISPROVE the cluster abbreviation hypothesis (the character form itself could be the signal), but it means the physical evidence alone is insufficient to confirm it.

**Severity:** MODERATE. The cluster abbreviation claim is central to the ZFD decode but cannot be validated or refuted from physical observation alone.

## Disagreement 2: 'ch' and 'sh' Treatment

**Character map claims:** 'ch' → /h/ (single phoneme) and 'sh' → /š/ (single phoneme). The map treats these as individual operators.

**Physical observation:** 'ch' and 'sh' are physically TWO-COMPONENT LIGATURES. In careful hand, the crescent/curve and the tall stroke are visibly separate elements. They fuse in rapid hand but retain their two-part structure in careful execution.

**Why this matters:** If 'ch' and 'sh' are ligatures (two characters conventionally written together), they might represent two SOUNDS rather than one. The character map's assignment of single phonemes may be correct as a linguistic reading, but the physical evidence shows these are compound forms, not atomic characters. A paleographer working purely from physical evidence would classify them as ligatures, not simple characters.

**Severity:** LOW-MODERATE. This affects how the compounds are described, not necessarily their phonemic value.

## Disagreement 3: Confidence in i/n/r/l Distinction

**Character map claims:** Confident separate assignments — i→/i/, n→/n/, r→/r/, l→/l/. These are treated as reliably distinguishable characters.

**Physical observation:** At ~150 DPI:
- 'i' vs. 'n': Distinguished primarily by POSITION (word-final = 'n'), not by form. The rightward base curve of 'n' is unreliable in rapid hand.
- 'i' vs. 'r': The hook distinguishing 'r' is at or below the resolution limit (~2-3px of curvature). Frequently indistinguishable.
- 'i' vs. 'l': Distinguished only by height. At intermediate heights, ambiguous.
- 'n' vs. 'r': Both involve subtle modifications to basic vertical strokes. Very difficult to separate.

**Why this matters:** If these characters cannot be physically distinguished with confidence, then transcriptions that assign them distinct readings are making interpretive choices, not recording physical facts. Any EVA transcription that claims to reliably separate 'i', 'n', 'r', and 'l' at every instance is applying contextual rules (positional, linguistic) beyond what the image alone shows.

**Severity:** HIGH. This affects the reliability of ALL corpus-level transcription data.

## Disagreement 4: 'aiin' Structure

**Character map claims:** The map treats 'aiin' as a single suffix unit '-ain' (d-a-ii-n → /d-a-in/).

**Physical observation:** 'aiin' is NOT a single opaque unit. It shows a two-level structure:
- Level 1: 'a' + 'iin' (the 'a' maintains slight separation from 'iin' in standard and careful hand)
- Level 2: 'iin' is a tightly-fused sub-unit ('i' + 'i' + 'n' are compressed closer together than any other character group)

The map's treatment as '-ain' is not wrong — 'aiin' does function as a unit in rapid hand. But the physical evidence suggests the internal structure is 'a' + 'iin' rather than 'a-i-i-n' or monolithic '-aiin'.

**Severity:** LOW. This is a refinement of the map's claim, not a contradiction. The distinction between 'a+iin' and 'aiin' may not affect the phonemic reading.

## Disagreement 5: Absence of Discussed Limitations

**Character map claims:** The map presents its readings with HIGH/MEDIUM confidence labels but does not discuss the physical limitations of the source transcription data.

**Physical observation:** Several types of ambiguity are inherent in the script at available resolution:
- 'o' vs. 'a' in rapid hand (~10% ambiguous)
- 'ch' vs. 'sh' in rapid hand (~20% ambiguous)
- 'i' vs. 'r' at any speed (majority of instances ambiguous)
- 'l' vs. tall 'i' at intermediate heights

These ambiguities mean that ANY corpus analysis based on EVA transcription carries inherent error from the transcription layer. The character map does not acknowledge this source of uncertainty.

**Severity:** MODERATE. Not a disagreement with specific readings but with the confidence framework.

## Disagreement 6: Gallows Height and "Abbreviation Mark Function"

**Character map claims (Section 1.3):** "They appear MID-WORD (not word-initial like simple consonants)" and "They have complex shapes (ligature composites, not single letters)."

**Physical observation:**
- The positional claim (mid-word) is CONFIRMED by observation. Gallows do appear primarily in medial position.
- The "complex shapes" claim is ONLY supported for Type C (dual-shaft π-shape). Types A and B are not notably more complex than other characters — they are simply TALLER. Height alone does not indicate complexity or ligature origin.
- The characterization of gallows as "not single letters" is contradicted by Types A and B, which physically appear to be single-stroke characters (shaft + loop, executed in one movement).

**Severity:** MODERATE. The map overstates the physical complexity of gallows Types A and B.

## Summary

| # | Claim | Physical Evidence | Agreement |
|---|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Gallows = cluster abbreviations | No abbreviation marks; A/B look single-stroke | PARTIAL (C supports, A/B do not) |
| 2 | ch→/h/, sh→/š/ (single phonemes) | Physical ligatures (two components) | UNCERTAIN (ligature ≠ phoneme) |
| 3 | i/n/r/l reliably distinct | Frequently indistinguishable at 150 DPI | DISAGREE |
| 4 | 'aiin' = single suffix '-ain' | Two-level structure: 'a' + 'iin' | PARTIAL (suffix function confirmed, internal structure refined) |
| 5 | Confidence framework adequate | Doesn't acknowledge resolution-inherent ambiguities | DISAGREE |
| 6 | Gallows have "complex shapes" | Only Type C is genuinely complex | PARTIAL |

**Overall:** The existing character map's POSITIONAL analysis is well-supported by physical observation. Its PHONEMIC claims cannot be evaluated from physical evidence alone. Its confidence framework understates the ambiguity inherent in the script at available resolution.
