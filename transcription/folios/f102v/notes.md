# Folio f102v2 -- Transcription Notes

## Page Structure

f102v2 is a pharmaceutical page from the recipe/pharmaceutical section of the Voynich Manuscript. It contains:
- **2 container labels** (L1-L2, L24) flanking a central illustration area
- **14 plant/figure labels** in 3 rows (L3-L9, L10-L16, L25-L29)
- **2 text blocks** (P1: L17-L23, P2: L30-L39)
- Plant and apparatus illustrations between text regions

This is a dense pharmaceutical folio comparable in structure to f88r but with more extensive labeling and a clearer recipe-to-administration progression.

## Validated Readings

### "orolaly" (L37) -- Latin Pharmaceutical Term
The confirmed Latin term "orolaly" (= orally, oral administration) appears in L37 at the EVA region "okeo.r!oly". The mechanical ZFD parse yields "osteo. r!oli" (bone-substance + uncertain-oil), but the confirmed pharmaceutical reading identifies this as the Latin term for oral administration. This is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for Latin pharmaceutical vocabulary embedded in the Voynich text.

### "sal" (L34) -- Salt
Standard pharmaceutical ingredient. Identity mapping (s + a + l = sal). Appears at line end in the same text block as "orolaly", in the administration section of the recipe.

### "dol" (L20) -- Dolor?
"dol" appears in Text Block 1, parsed from EVA "dol". If this is Latin "dolor" (pain), it represents a therapeutic indication within the recipe. Context: appears alongside "ostei" (bone-adj) and preparation terms, suggesting the recipe targets bone-related pain.

### Bone Vocabulary (ost- stems)
Multiple "ost-" bone compounds throughout:
- "osteos" (L6) = of bone/bone substance (cf. Latin osteum)
- "osteor" (L18, L32, etc.) = bone-oil-agent
- "osteol" (L18, L32, L34, etc.) = bone-oil
- "ostodi" (L10) = bone-processed
- "ostoroei" (L12) = bone-oil-instance

## Recipe Structure

The two text blocks form a complete pharmaceutical recipe:

### Text Block 1 (L17-L23): Preparation
- **L17:** Opening with multiple process terms (pour, treat, soak, cook)
- **L18:** Core ingredients: "osteor" (bone-oil-agent) and "osteol" (bone-oil) repeated 3x
- **L19-L20:** Complex processing steps with "koosteodi" (which-bone-processed)
- **L20:** Possible pain reference "dol" = therapeutic target
- **L21-L22:** Continued processing with soak and cook terms
- **L23:** Short closing: "otreo. ostei. shei. ostei" (treat + bone + soak + bone)

### Text Block 2 (L30-L39): Application/Administration
- **L30:** Opens with "plidaei" (pour-substance) and preparation terms
- **L32:** Direct instruction "dar" (give/administer) + "osteol" (bone-oil) + "dain" (substance)
- **L34:** "sal" (salt) appears as ingredient/vehicle
- **L35:** "plor" (pour-oil) suggests liquid preparation
- **L37:** **"orolaly" (orally)** specifies administration route + "sar" (salt-agent) + "stor" (bone-oil)
- **L38-L39:** Recipe closing with "dor" (give-oil), "koosteor" (which-bone-agent)

**Recipe Summary:** Prepare bone-oil with cooking and soaking processes → combine with salt → administer orally.

## Comparison with f88r (Gold Standard)

| Feature | f102v2 | f88r |
|---------|--------|------|
| Section | Pharmaceutical | Pharmaceutical |
| Layout | Labels + 2 text blocks | 3 registers + labels |
| Validated terms | orolaly, sal, dol(?) | ostol, otrorhetri |
| Label count | ~19 | 15 |
| Text lines | ~23 | 16 |
| Administration | Explicit ("orolaly") | Not specified |
| Latin terms | orolaly, sal, dol(?) | None confirmed |
| ok-operator in labels | ~12 (dominant) | Present |
| Recipe clarity | Clear prep→admin progression | Process-focused |

f102v2 provides stronger evidence for Latin pharmaceutical vocabulary than f88r. The explicit "orolaly" (orally) term and the clear preparation-to-administration recipe progression strengthen the pharmaceutical thesis.

## Operator Distribution

| Operator | EVA Form | ZFD | Count | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----|-------|-------|
| ok | ok | ost | ~12 | Dominant in labels. Bone/vessel terms. |
| ch | ch | h | ~15 | Common in text blocks. "heor", "hei", etc. |
| sh | sh | sh | ~12 | "shei", "sheor", "sho". Soaking terms. |
| qo | qo | ko | ~10 | In text blocks. "koosteor", "koostei". |
| ot | ot | otr | ~8 | Labels and text. "otrol", "otrori", "otreo". |
| da | da | da | ~5 | "dain", "dar", "dal". Recipe instructions. |

The high frequency of ok→ost operator in labels (12 instances) confirms that labels on pharmaceutical pages predominantly describe bone-related preparations.

## Gallows Distribution

| Gallows | EVA | ZFD | Count | Examples |
|---------|-----|-----|-------|----------|
| k-gallows | k | st | ~25 | Dominant. osteos, osteor, osteol, ostodi, etc. |
| t-gallows | t | tr | ~5 | otrol, trhor, otrori |
| Bench ckh | ckh | hst | ~4 | chckhhy→hhsthi, okockhy→ostohsti |
| Bench cth | cth | htr | ~3 | ctheor→htreor, cthey→htrei |
| p-gallows | p | pl | ~4 | porshols→plorshols, pydaeey→plidaei |
| f-gallows | f | pr | 0 | Absent from f102v2 |

The absence of f-gallows (→pr, heat/pour) is notable. f102v2 focuses on bone-oil preparations rather than heating processes.

## Label Patterns

### Container Labels (3)
- L1 "plorshols" -- compound vessel term (pour + oil + soak + oils)
- L2 "soe. di" -- substance-of, given
- L24 "otrolsti" -- treated bone-oil preparation

### Plant/Figure Labels by Row
**Row 1 (L3-L9):** Heart-leaf (oror), three-lobed (eeor), wing-shaped (sahi), cube root (osteos), wing-shaped (otrol), spatula (otrori), many-fingered (ost??)
**Row 2 (L10-L16):** Candy flower (ostodi), comb-leaf (heor), claw-comb (ostoroei), pine-like (oplhi), club-fingers (sarol), knob-fingers (olrodar), cypress (trod?!!)
**Row 3 (L25-L29):** Small root (ora!!n), dark roots (oista), carrot (osteeo!rain), serrated leaf (ostohsti), faded (e???ddi)

Label vocabulary is more formulaic than body text. Most use ok/ot operators followed by simple suffix patterns.

## Confidence Distribution

| Grade | Lines | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| A | 0 lines | No line-level gold standard (word-level: orolaly, sal) |
| B | ~15 lines | L18, L20, L32, L34-L38, and clear labels |
| C | ~17 lines | Most labels and complex text lines |
| D | ~5 lines | L9, L16, L25, L29 (partially illegible labels), L19 |

## Latin Pharmaceutical Terms Index

| Term | Line | EVA Region | ZFD Mechanical | Latin Meaning |
|------|------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| orolaly | L37 | okeo.r!oly | osteo.r!oli | orally (administration route) |
| sal | L34 | sal | sal | salt (ingredient) |
| dol | L20 | dol | dol | dolor = pain (therapeutic indication) |
| osteos | L6 | okeos | osteos | of bone (cf. Latin osteum) |

## Anomalies

1. **"oeoikhy" (L19):** Unusual cluster "oeoi" followed by bench-like "khy". May be a misread or scribal error. Parsed as "oeoisthi" but uncertain.
2. **"chckhhy" (L17):** Double bench gallows compound. Parsed as "hhsthi" (cook-cook-bone-adj). Unusual double-h reading.
3. **"qekeor" (L20) vs "qokeor" (elsewhere):** The "e" instead of "o" in the ko-operator position suggests either a variant spelling or a different word. Parsed as "kesteor" (determine-bone-agent).
4. **Multiple ! markers:** The H transcription contains numerous uncertainty markers (!), particularly in labels L9, L16, L25, L29. These represent areas of ink fading or damage.
5. **"plorshols" (L1):** Very long compound label with both p-gallows and sh-operator. Unusual for label vocabulary.
