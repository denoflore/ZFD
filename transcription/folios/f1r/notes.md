# Folio f1r -- Transcription Notes

## Page Structure

f1r is the opening/title page of the Voynich Manuscript. Unlike most manuscript folios which feature large plant or astronomical illustrations, f1r is text-dominant with four paragraphs of body text, each followed by a short right-justified title line. A small herbal illustration appears between paragraphs 2 and 3 but does not dominate the layout.

- **Paragraph 1 (L1-L5):** 5 lines, no decorative initial
- **Title 1 (L6):** Right-justified, heavily uncertain
- **Paragraph 2 (L7-L9):** 3 lines, opens with "weirdo" @252 initial
- **Title 2 (L10):** Right-justified, "dain os treodi"
- **Paragraph 3 (L11-L20):** 10 lines, opens with "weirdo" @253 initial. Longest paragraph.
- **Title 3 (L21):** Right-justified, "otrol dain"
- **Paragraph 4 (L22-L27):** 6 lines, no decorative initial
- **Title 4 (L28):** Right-justified, "dhain"
- **Key sequences (L29-L31):** Faint vertical columns in right margin

## The "Weirdo" Decorated Initials

Two non-standard glyphs appear at the start of Paragraphs 2 and 3:

- **@252 (L7):** V-shape with underbar, thick red/brown brushed strokes, swallowtail serifs. NOT part of the standard script inventory.
- **@253 (L11):** Similar to @252 but with a squiggly ascending line between the horns.

These are unique to f1r and may function as:
- Section/paragraph markers (rubric initials)
- Non-scribal additions (later hand)
- Decorative elements marking major divisions

They do not appear elsewhere in the manuscript.

## Tepenecz Signature

Faint text at the top of the page has been identified as the signature of Jacobus Horicky de Tepenecz (d. 1622), one of the manuscript's documented owners. This is a later addition unrelated to the original text. UV photography has confirmed the signature.

## Right-Margin Key Sequences

A ~1 inch stained band along the right margin contains faint key-like letter sequences arranged in three vertical columns (L29-L31). Jim Reeds (1994) and Brumbaugh have discussed these. They appear separate from the main text and may represent:
- Cipher key or index
- Scribal notes
- Later owner annotations

The three sequences read approximately: d, r, g (very uncertain).

## Operator Distribution

| Operator | EVA Form | ZFD | Count | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----|-------|-------|
| ch | ch | h | ~20+ | Dominant operator. Appears as initial in "chol", "chor", "chey", etc. |
| sh | sh | s/sh | ~15 | Second most common. "shol", "shody", "shey", etc. |
| da | da | da | ~10 | In "daiin/dain" words. Recipe instruction terms. |
| ok | ok | ost | ~5 | Including validated "ostol" (L24). Bone-related. |
| ot | ot | otr | ~5 | "otrol", "otreos", "otrain". Treatment terms. |
| d | d | d | ~8 | As word-initial. "dain", "dar", "dor". |
| qo | qo | ko | 0 | **Absent from f1r.** This is unusual since qo is the most common operator manuscript-wide. |

The absence of the qo-operator is notable and may indicate f1r's content is from a different genre or sub-section than folios where qo is prevalent.

## Gallows Distribution

| Gallows | EVA | ZFD | Count | Examples |
|---------|-----|-----|-------|----------|
| k-gallows | k | st | ~28 | kor→stor, kol→stol, okol→ostol, okan→ostan |
| t-gallows | t | tr | ~14 | ataiin→atrain, oteos→otreos, teody→treodi |
| Bench cth | cth | htr | ~14 | cthar→htrar, cthol→htrol, cthy→htri |
| Bench cph | cph | hpl | ~7 | cphoy→hploi, cphey→hplei, cpho→hplo |
| Bench ckh | ckh | hst | ~5 | ckhar→hstar, ckhey→hstei |
| Bench cfh | cfh | hpr | ~3 | cfhaiin→hprain, cfhol→hprol |
| f-gallows | f | pr | ~3 | far→prar, fachys→prahis |
| p-gallows | p | pl | ~3 | pshol→plshol, pydeey→plidei |

The k-gallows (→st, bone) is dominant, followed by bench gallows cth (→htr, cook-treat). This is consistent with pharmaceutical/recipe vocabulary.

## Key Validated Readings

| Word | Line | EVA | ZFD | Meaning | Validation |
|------|------|-----|-----|---------|------------|
| ostol | L24 | okol | ostol | bone oil | Cross-validated with f88r gold standard (Curio) |
| stol | L15 | kol | stol | bone-oil | Consistent stem with ostol |
| dain | L9,L14,L18,L20,L24,L25 | daiin | dain | given/substance | High frequency, consistent parsing |
| hol | L14,L15,L16,L22,L23,L24,L27 | chol | hol | cook-oil | ~7 instances, stable reading |
| hor | L15,L20 | chor | hor | cook-agent | Consistent pharmaceutical term |
| dar | L23 | dar | dar | give-agent | Recipe instruction term |
| stor | L1,L15 | kor | stor | bone-agent | Consistent with pharmaceutical domain |

## Anomalies

1. **"dydyd" (L17):** The EVA sequence produces "didid" in ZFD -- an unusual repetitive pattern with no clear linguistic meaning. May represent:
   - Dosage repetition formula ("three times")
   - Scribal ditto mark or emphasis
   - Corrupted text

2. **@K variant gallows (L15):** A non-standard form of the k-gallows appears in "ck<!@K>eor". This variant may indicate a different cluster abbreviation or a scribal decoration.

3. **@T variant gallows (L19):** A non-standard form appearing in "dloct<!@T>a". Similar to @K, this may be a special variant of the t-gallows.

4. **Heavy uncertainty zones:** Lines 6, 7, 19, and 25-27 contain multiple unreadable or uncertain characters (marked ! and ? in EVA). These coincide with the stained right margin area and areas of ink fading.

5. **No qo-operator:** The complete absence of the qo→ko operator (the manuscript's most frequent) is striking and may indicate a genre difference.

## Language Classification

Currier Language A, Hand 1. The careful, deliberate writing style with consistent letter spacing and clear word boundaries supports this being the opening or dedication page. The scribe appears to have written f1r with maximum deliberation.

## Comparison with f88r (Gold Standard)

| Feature | f1r | f88r |
|---------|-----|------|
| Section | Text/opening | Pharmaceutical apparatus |
| Layout | 4 paragraphs + titles | 3 registers + labels |
| Core vocabulary | ostol, dain, hol, hor, stor | ostol, otrorhetri, dain |
| Bench gallows | Very high (~29 instances) | Moderate |
| qo-operator | Absent | Present |
| Validation | "ostol" cross-validated | "ostol" + "otrorhetri" Curio-validated |
| Confidence | Mostly C (uncertain) | Mixed B-C with 2 A's |
| Recipe structure | Embedded in paragraphs | Organized by apparatus register |

Both folios share core pharmaceutical vocabulary, confirming that f1r, despite being the "opening page," contains pharmaceutical/recipe content consistent with the rest of the manuscript.
