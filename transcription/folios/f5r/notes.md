# Folio f5r -- Transcription Notes

## Page Structure

f5r is a herbal page in Quire A/I, part of bifolio bA4 (f4+f5). It is the recto of a leaf whose verso (f5v) is also a herbal page. The folio contains 7 lines of text from the H (Hermes) transcriber, with a plant illustration.

- **Total lines:** 7
- **Total words (EVA):** 53
- **Currier:** Language A, Hand 1

## Operator Distribution

| Operator | EVA Form | ZFD | Count | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----|-------|-------|
| ch | ch | h | ~14 | Dominant operator. Appears in "chody", "chey", "cheor", "cho", "chocthy", etc. |
| sh | sh | sh | ~8 | Second most common. "sho" (x3), "shody" (x2), "shodaiin", "sheody", "shotshy". |
| qo | qo | ko | ~7 | Well-represented. "qoaiin" (x2), "qokaiin", "qotcheo", "qoeeey", "qoykeeey", "qoeor", "qotcho", "qotoeey". |
| ot | ot | otr | ~5 | "otan", "oteeen", "otchy", "otain", "otol". Treatment terms. |
| ok | ok | ost | ~3 | "okey", "oka?or", "otol" (via ot operator, not ok). Only "okey" and "oka?or" use ok. |
| da | da | da | ~2 | In "daiin" words. |
| d | d | d | ~3 | As word-initial. "dkshy", "dy" (x2). |

### Notable: qo-operator presence

Unlike f1r where the qo-operator is entirely absent, f5r has 7 qo-operator words. This is significant because qo is the most common operator manuscript-wide. The presence of qo on f5r is consistent with standard herbal section vocabulary.

## Gallows Frequency

| Gallows | Count | Expansion | Percentage |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| k (->st) | 9 | bone cluster | 39% |
| t (->tr) | 8 | treat cluster | 35% |
| f (->pr) | 1 | pour cluster | 4% |
| p (->pl) | 0 | pour cluster | 0% |
| Bench cth (->htr) | 4 | cook-treat | 17% |
| Bench ckh (->hst) | 1 | cook-bone | 4% |

The k-gallows (bone) and t-gallows (treat) are nearly equally represented. This is different from f1r and f2r where k-gallows dominates more strongly. The near-equal distribution may reflect balanced vocabulary about both bone preparations and treatment processes.

## Suffix Distribution

| Suffix | EVA | Count | ZFD Value | Function |
|--------|-----|-------|-----------|----------|
| -y (->i) | y | ~21 | -i | adjective/genitive |
| -aiin (->ain) | aiin | ~5 | -ain | substance noun |
| -eey (->ei) | eey | ~4 | -ei | adjective |
| -ol | ol | ~3 | -ol | oil-related noun |
| -or | or | ~5 | -or | agent/oil |
| -ar | ar | ~1 | -ar | water |
| -n | n | ~4 | -n | noun |

The -y (->i, adjective) suffix is strongly dominant (~40% of words end with it), suggesting descriptive text. The -or (agent) suffix is also well-represented.

## Recurring Vocabulary

Words appearing 2+ times across the folio:

| ZFD | Count | Lines | English |
|-----|-------|-------|---------|
| sho | 3 | L2, L5, L6 | with-soak |
| shodi | 2 | L5, L7 | with-soak-adj |
| koain | 2 | L3, L5 | which-substance |
| hei | 2 | L2, L6 | cook-adj |
| heor | 2 | L4, L6 | cook-e-agent |
| htri | 2 | L3, L6 | cook-treat-adj |
| di | 3 | L1, L3, L6 | to-adj |
| dain | 2 | L3, L5 | given/substance |
| hstoi | 2 | L1, L2 | cook-bone-adj |

The most frequent terms are "sho" (with-soak) and "di" (to-adj), suggesting recipe instructions and descriptive modifiers. The appearance of "hstoi" (cook-bone-adj) twice reinforces the pharmaceutical preparation vocabulary.

## Anomalies and Unusual Features

1. **"cholols" (L5):** EVA "cholols" -> ch(->h) + o + l + o + l + s = "holols". The double-ol pattern is unusual. This may represent:
   - A compound "hol" + "ols" (cook-oil + oil-s)
   - A scribal repetition
   - A specific preparation term involving double oil reference

2. **"oteeen" (L3):** EVA "oteeen" -> ot(->otr) + e + e + e + n = "otreeen". The triple-e sequence is highly unusual. Similar multi-vowel sequences appear elsewhere in the manuscript but are rare. May represent:
   - A scribal elongation or emphasis marker
   - A specific phonetic sequence
   - Minim ambiguity (e's could be partially different characters)

3. **"koistei" (L6):** EVA "qoykeeey" -> qo(->ko) + y(->i) + k(->st) + e + eey(->ei) = "koistei". This is the most complex parse on f5r, with four separate transformations in a single word. The resulting form is phonotactically dense but follows all rules mechanically.

4. **"shotrshi" (L6):** EVA "shotshy" -> sh + o + t(->tr) + sh + y(->i) = "shotrshi". Contains two sh digraphs in a single word, which is unusual. The medial t-gallows expansion creates a dense cluster "trsh".

5. **Triple qo-operator cluster (L6):** Three consecutive words begin with the qo-operator: "koeei", "koistei", "koeor". This clustering may indicate a list, parallel construction, or formulaic repetition.

6. **f-gallows rarity:** Only one f-gallows word appears on the entire folio ("fchoy" -> "prhoi" in L1). The f-gallows (->pr, pour) is consistently the rarest gallows type across the manuscript.

## Comparison with Adjacent Folios

f5r shares its bifolio (bA4) with f4. As a herbal page in the early herbal section (Herbal A), it exhibits:
- **Higher qo-operator density** than f1r (which has zero qo-operators)
- **Balanced k/t gallows ratio** compared to the strong k-dominance on f1r and f2r
- **Standard herbal vocabulary** with references to soaking (sho, shodi), cooking (hei, heor, htri), bone preparations (stei, hstoi, kostain), and treatment (otrol, otran, otrain)

## Confidence Distribution Summary

- **B (clear morpheme structure):** 1 line (L7) -- ~14% of lines
- **C (systematic but uncertain):** 6 lines (L1-L6) -- ~86% of lines
- **D (highly uncertain):** 0 lines

The overall confidence profile is moderate. L7 achieves B-confidence due to its short length and standard vocabulary. The remaining lines have no uncertain characters but involve complex multi-transformation parses whose semantic interpretation remains uncertain.
