## Illustrations

### Center
A goat-like animal (ram/Aries) nibbling at a bush or plant, standing on scalloped ground. Below the animal is the non-Voynich word "ab\*i\*l" -- this is one of the few non-Voynich script annotations in the manuscript and may be a later addition.

### Outer Band (10 nymphs)
Ten nymphs standing in barrels arranged around the outer band. Each nymph holds or is adjacent to a star or flower shape. Each has a label (L2--L11). Clock positions noted in parentheses.

### Inner Band (5 nymphs)
Five nymphs standing in barrels arranged around the inner band. Each has a star/flower and a label (L13--L17). Clock positions noted in parentheses.

### Text Rings
Three rings of circular text:
- **Outer ring (L1):** Outermost continuous text ring, 38 words
- **Middle ring (L12):** Between the two nymph bands, 23+ words (gap near end)
- **Inner ring (L18):** Innermost continuous text ring, 10 words

**L1 Interpretation:** The outer ring text is heavily dominated by ok(ost) and ot(otr) prefixed words, with recurring -ar, -al, -ol suffixes. The vocabulary overlaps with pharmaceutical morphemes (ost=bone, or/ol=oil, ar=water, sal=salt), but in a zodiac context these may carry different semantic weight. The text may describe properties of the nymphs or zodiac positions. Several uncertain readings (!) and the long compound word #16 suggest either scribal difficulty or genuinely complex terminology. Overall confidence for this ring is C--D.

## Outer Band Nymph Labels (L2--L11)

10 labels for nymphs arranged in the outer band. Clock positions from the EVA transcription are noted.

| Line | Clock | EVA (H) | ZFD Croatian | Parsing | Gloss | Conf |

| L4 | 00:15 | oteoaldy | otreoaldi | ot(otr)+e+o+a+l+d+y(i) | vessel-substance-adj | C |
| L5 | 01:15 | oteolar | otreolar | ot(otr)+e+o+l+ar | vessel-oil-agent | C |
| L6 | 02:15 | okeoaly | osteoali | ok(ost)+e+o+a+l+y(i) | bone-substance-adj | C |
| L7 | 03:15 | otaleky | otralesti | ot(otr)+a+l+e+k(st)+y(i) | vessel-substance-bone-adj | C |
| L8 | 05:00 | otalsar | otralsar | ot(otr)+a+l+s+ar | vessel-substance-salt-agent | C |
| L9 | 06:15 | chsary | hsari | ch(h)+s+a+r+y(i) | cook-salt-adj | C |
| L10 | 07:30 | oteo!tey.sary | otreotrei. sari | ot(otr)+e+o+t(tr)+e+y(i) . s+a+r+y(i) | vessel-treat-adj. salt-adj [uncertain t] | C |
| L11 | 09:00 | otalaly | otralali | ot(otr)+a+l+a+l+y(i) | vessel-substance-substance-adj | C |

**Outer Band Label Patterns:**
- 8 of 10 labels begin with ot(otr) or ok(ost) operators.
- Most end with adjectival suffix -y(i) or agentive suffix -ar.
- L9 (chsary = "hsari") is the only label beginning with the ch(h) operator -- it may identify a nymph associated with a cooking/combining process.
- L3 (okldam = "ostldam") is morphologically unusual, with the consonant cluster -stld-. Confidence D.
- L10 has a two-part label with the uncertainty marker on the second gallows.

## Middle Ring Text (L12)

Continuous circular text between the outer and inner nymph bands. Approximately 23 words plus a gap at the end.

| # | EVA (H) | ZFD Croatian | Parsing | Gloss | Conf |
|---|---------|-------------|---------|-------|------|
| 1 | oteody | otreodi | ot(otr)+e+o+d+y(i) | vessel-process? | C |
| 2 | o!teos | otreos | o+t(tr)+e+o+s | topic-treat-substance | C |
| 3 | ockhey | ohstei | o+ckh(hst)+e+y(i) | topic-cook-bone-adj | C |
| 4 | oteesa!ey | otreesaei | ot(otr)+ee+s+a+e+y(i) | vessel-?-soak-adj [uncertain e] | D |
| 5 | lsheotey | lsheotrei | l+sh(sh)+e+o+t(tr)+e+y(i) | the-soak-treat-adj | D |
| 6 | okal!ody | ostalodi | ok(ost)+a+l+o+d+y(i) | bone-substance-process [uncertain o] | C |
| 7 | shs | shs | sh(sh)+s | soak-with | D |
| 8 | shey | shei | sh(sh)+e+y(i) | soak-adj | C |
| 9 | oteey | otreei | ot(otr)+ee+y(i) | vessel-instance | C |
| 10 | otechar | otrehar | ot(otr)+e+ch(h)+ar | vessel-cook-agent | C |
| 11 | che!kal | hestal | ch(h)+e+k(st)+a+l | cook-bone-substance [uncertain k] | C |
| 12 | okody | ostodi | ok(ost)+o+d+y(i) | bone-process? | C |
| 13 | eeedy | eeedi | eee+d+y(i) OR ee+edy(edi) | intensifier-process | D |
| 14 | oteodal | otreodal | ot(otr)+e+o+d+a+l | vessel-?-given-substance | C |
| 15 | !!okol | ostol | ok(ost)+o+l | bone-oil [strong uncertainty !!] | C |
| 16 | lkchol | lsthol | l+k(st)+ch(h)+o+l | the-bone-cook-oil [unusual cluster] | D |
| 17 | daiin | dain | da(da)+iin(ain) | give-substance / dose | B |

| 19 | ykees | istees | y(i)+k(st)+ee+s | adj-bone-?-with | D |
| 20 | al | al | al | substance | B |
| 21 | okchy | osthi | ok(ost)+ch(h)+y(i) | bone-cook-adj | C |
| 22 | otey | otrei | ot(otr)+e+y(i) | vessel-adj | C |
| 23 | oteoshaly | otreoshali | ot(otr)+e+o+sh(sh)+a+l+y(i) | vessel-soak-substance-adj | C |
| -- | \<gap\>o | ...o | gap in text | [text gap, followed by 'o'] | -- |

**L12 Interpretation:** The middle ring shares vocabulary with L1. Notable: word #15 "!!okol" parses as "ostol" (bone oil) -- identical to the validated f88r label -- but the double uncertainty marks (!!) in the EVA transcription indicate the transcriber was not confident in this reading. Word #17 "daiin" = "dain" (give-substance/dose) is a common pharmaceutical term. The "lsheotey" (#5) beginning with 'l' is unusual; 'l' is not a standard ZFD operator, and this word may have a structural role (perhaps a determiner). Overall confidence: C--D.

## Inner Band Nymph Labels (L13--L17)

5 labels for nymphs arranged in the inner band.

| Line | Clock | EVA (H) | ZFD Croatian | Parsing | Gloss | Conf |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|---------|-------|------|
| L13 | 11:00 | otol.chdy | otrol. hdi | ot(otr)+o+l . ch(h)+d+y(i) | vessel-oil. cook-adj | C |
| L14 | 01:15 | otoloaram | otroloaram | ot(otr)+o+l+o+a+r+a+m | vessel-oil-?-water-instrumental | D |
| L15 | 03:15 | oteeol | otreeol | ot(otr)+ee+o+l | vessel-intensifier-oil | C |
| L16 | 06:15 | otolchd | otrolhd | ot(otr)+o+l+ch(h)+d | vessel-oil-cook-completion | C |
| L17 | 09:00 | otal.dar | otral. dar | ot(otr)+a+l . d+ar | vessel-substance. give-agent | C |

**Inner Band Label Patterns:**
- All 5 labels begin with ot(otr).
- The -ol suffix (oil) appears in L13, L14, L15, L16, suggesting these inner nymphs may be associated with oil-related concepts.
- L14 (otoloaram = "otroloaram") is the longest inner label and ends with the instrumental suffix -am.
- L17 has a two-part label; "dar" (give-agent) is a known pharmaceutical term.

## Inner Ring Text (L18)

Continuous circular text forming the innermost ring. 10 words.

| # | EVA (H) | ZFD Croatian | Parsing | Gloss | Conf |
|---|---------|-------------|---------|-------|------|
| 1 | oteeol | otreeol | ot(otr)+ee+o+l | vessel-intensifier-oil | C |
| 2 | otal | otral | ot(otr)+a+l | vessel-substance | C |
| 3 | chs | hs | ch(h)+s | cook-with | C |
| 4 | char | har | ch(h)+ar | cook-agent / cook-water | C |
| 5 | cheky | hesti | ch(h)+e+k(st)+y(i) | cook-bone-adj | C |
| 6 | chetshy | hetrshi | ch(h)+e+t(tr)+sh(sh)+y(i) | cook-treat-soak-adj | C |
| 7 | okeeody | osteeodi | ok(ost)+ee+o+d+y(i) | bone-?-process | C |
| 8 | oteey | otreei | ot(otr)+ee+y(i) | vessel-instance | C |
| 9 | chekeen | hesteen | ch(h)+e+k(st)+ee+n | cook-bone-?-noun | C |
| 10 | okeol | osteol | ok(ost)+e+o+l | bone-oil | B |

**L18 Interpretation:** The inner ring is the shortest text, with only 10 words. It has more ch(h) operator words (4 of 10) than the other rings, suggesting cooking/combining processes. Word #10 "okeol" = "osteol" (bone-oil) is morphologically close to "ostol" (f88r validated) with an additional 'e'. Word #6 "chetshy" = "hetrshi" combines cook + treat + soak operators -- a triple-process term if the pharmaceutical glosses apply here. Overall confidence: B--C.

## Notes

### Zodiac Context Warning
This is a zodiac section folio. The pharmaceutical glosses (bone, oil, salt, cook, soak, etc.) are applied mechanically from the ZFD morpheme inventory, but their semantic applicability to zodiac/astrological content is **uncertain**. The vocabulary in zodiac sections may carry different meanings than in pharmaceutical sections. The labels may function as star names, positional identifiers, or astrological descriptors rather than recipe terms.

### Non-Voynich Annotation
The word "ab\*i\*l" below the central animal is written in non-Voynich script (possibly Latin or Hebrew). This is one of several non-Voynich annotations in the manuscript, often attributed to later owners or scholars.
