# Folio f116v -- Transcription Notes

## Page Type
Final page of the Voynich Manuscript. Fragmentary text. Single line recorded.

## Content
Only one line: "oror sheey" followed by extensive uncertainty markers (!!!!). "oror" = oil-oil (double oil reference, Conf B). Remainder is heavily damaged or illegible.

## Significance
As the final page, f116v may contain a colophon, scribal note, or ending formula. The fragmentary nature prevents confident reading.
