# Folio f2r -- Transcription Notes

## Key Observations

### Validation Status
This folio contains one validated gold-standard term and one standard pharmaceutical vocabulary item:
1. **"ostol" (EVA: okol, L12)** -- Bone oil. Validated by Curio adversarial methodology on f88r. The ok- operator expands to ost-, and k-gallows expands to -st-, producing "ostol" (ost=bone + ol=oil). Its appearance in the herbal section (not just pharmaceutical) demonstrates cross-section vocabulary consistency.
2. **"sal" (L12)** -- Salt. Standard pharmaceutical vocabulary. Identity mapping (no transformation needed). Appears in the same line as "ostol", anchoring L12 as the highest-confidence line on this folio.

### Herbal vs. Pharmaceutical Section Differences
Folio f2r is in the herbal section (Herbal A), not the pharmaceutical section. Compared to f88r (pharmaceutical):
- **Lower gallows density:** f2r has approximately 30 gallows expansions across 13 text lines, compared to f88r's approximately 40 across a similar line count. The k-gallows (->st, "bone") still dominates but is less overwhelming than in the pharmaceutical section.
- **More operator diversity:** The herbal text uses a wider range of operators (sh-, d-, da-, ot-) where the pharmaceutical text is heavily weighted toward ch- (heat/cook) and qo- (which).
- **Plant-text interaction:** The unique feature of f2r is that the plant illustration physically interrupts almost every text line. This is completely different from f88r where text blocks are in discrete registers separated from illustrations.
- **Bench gallows frequency:** "cth" and "ckh" bench gallows appear frequently (12+ occurrences), suggesting compound pharmaceutical process terms even within the herbal section.

### Plant-Text Interaction Pattern
The plant illustration interrupts 12 of the 13 text lines (only L13, the final line of P2, has no plant break). The breaks occur at the following frequency:
- L1: 2 breaks (flowers)
- L2: 2 breaks (flowers)
- L3: 3 breaks (flowers) -- most interruptions
- L4: 3 breaks (flowers)
- L5: 3 breaks (plant body)
- L6: 3 breaks (plant body)
- L7: 1 break (plant body, end of P1)
- L8: 1 break (branches)
- L9: 1 break (branches)
- L10: 1 break (branches)
- L11: 1 break (branches)
- L12: 1 break (branches)
- L13: 0 breaks

**Pattern:** P1 (upper text) has more breaks per line because it wraps around the flower heads at the top. P2 (lower text) has fewer breaks because it wraps around the narrower branches/stems. This demonstrates that the scribe wrote the text AROUND the illustration, not vice versa -- the illustration was drawn first or its position was planned before writing.

### Transcriber Agreement
Three transcriber variants are available for this folio: H (Hermes), C (Currier), F (Friedman).

**Full agreement (all three match):** L3, L7, L12, L13 -- these are the highest-confidence readings.

**Notable disagreements:**
- **L2 final word:** H reads "cth!" (uncertain), C reads "???!" (illegible), F reads "ctho". The final character is genuinely ambiguous in the manuscript.
- **L4 first word:** H reads "chaindy", C reads "!?aiidy" (uncertain initial), F reads "shaiidy". The word-initial glyph is ambiguous between ch- and sh- operators. This affects the ZFD reading: "haindi" (H) vs. "shaiidi" (F).
- **L5 word 5:** H/F read "!dan" (uncertain initial), C reads "chan". The ZFD interpretation differs: "dan" (given) vs. "han" (heat-substance).
- **L8 word 7:** H/F read "yksh", C reads "ytsh". This changes the gallows: k(->st) vs. t(->tr), giving "istsh" vs. "itrsh".
- **L9 final word:** H/F read "daiirol", C reads "daiirdl". The final two characters differ.
- **L11 word 7:** H/F read "olsaiin", C reads "??saiin" (uncertain initial).

### Gallows Frequency
| Gallows | Count | Expansion | Percentage |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| k (->st) | 18 | bone cluster | 60% |
| t (->tr) | 8 | treat cluster | 27% |
| p (->pl) | 2 | pour cluster | 7% |
| f (->pr) | 1 | heat/pour cluster | 3% |
| Bench (c+gallows) | 12 | compound | -- |

The k-gallows dominance (60%) reflects the frequent "bone" (ost-/st-) morpheme, consistent with a preparation involving bone oil. The t-gallows (27%) indicates "treatment" vocabulary. The f-gallows appears only once ("fodan" -> "prodan" in L8), which is unusual and may indicate a specific process term.

### Operator Distribution
| Operator | EVA | Count | ZFD Value | Meaning |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------|---------|
| ch- | ch | ~18 | h- | heat/cook/action |
| sh- | sh | ~8 | sh- | soak/with |
| d/da- | d/da | ~10 | d/da | give/to |
| qo- | qo | ~5 | ko- | which/relative |
| ot- | ot | ~2 | otr- | treat/process |
| ok- | ok | 1 | ost- | bone (in "ostol") |

The ch- operator dominance is consistent with herbal preparation text (heating/cooking instructions). The sh- operator (soaking) appears frequently, suggesting the cornflower preparation involves steeping or infusion -- consistent with the historical use of Centaurea cyanus infusions as febrifuge and eye wash.

### Suffix Distribution
| Suffix | EVA | Count | ZFD Value | Function |
|--------|-----|-------|-----------|----------|
| -y (->i) | y | ~25 | -i | adjective/genitive |
| -aiin (->ain) | aiin | ~10 | -ain | substance noun |
| -eey (->ei) | eey | ~4 | -ei | adjective |
| -ol | ol | ~8 | -ol | oil-related noun |
| -or | or | ~6 | -or | agent/oil |
| -an | an | ~3 | -an | noun |
| -al | al | ~3 | -al | substance noun |
| -n | n | ~5 | -n | noun |
| -r | r | ~3 | -r | agent |
| -l | l | ~3 | -l | noun |

The suffix -y (->i, adjective) is the most common, consistent with descriptive herbal text. The -aiin (->ain) suffix marks substance nouns and appears throughout.

### Recurring Vocabulary
Words appearing 2+ times across the folio:

| ZFD | Count | Lines | English |
|-----|-------|-------|---------|
| dain | 6 | L1,L5,L8,L9,L10,L13 | substance/given |
| hol | 5 | L5,L7,L9,L10,L12 | heat-oil |
| dan | 4 | L5(x2),L7,L11 | given |
| sain | 4 | L6,L10(x2),L12 | soak-substance |
| hi | 4 | L3,L6,L11,L12 | heated (adj) |
| shor | 3 | L2,L7,L8 (as shol) | soak-oil |
| shol | 2 | L8,L10 | soak-oil |
| ctrhi | 3 | L2,L6(x2) | treat-heat-adj |
| ctrhei | 2 | L3,L10 | treat-heat-adj |
| hor | 2 | L3,L12 | heat-agent |
| dal | 2 | L4,L11 | gave/portion |
| shei | 2 | L9,L11 | soaked/washed (adj) |

The most frequent term "dain" (substance) appears in nearly half of all lines, suggesting it functions as a general-purpose noun (the preparation, the substance being described). "hol" (heat-oil) and "dan" (given) are recipe-action terms.

### Anomalies and Unusual Features

1. **"dlssho" (L9):** This word has an unusual consonant cluster (d-l-s-sh-o) that does not decompose cleanly into standard ZFD morphemes. The initial "dl" cluster is rare in Croatian. Confidence D. May be a compound abbreviation or scribal error.

2. **"daiildi" (L8) and "daiirol" (L9):** Both have unusual medial sequences. "daiildi" has a double-i followed by -l-d-i, and "daiirol" has double-i followed by -r-ol. These may represent compound suffix sequences or variant morphemes not yet catalogued.

3. **"prodan" (L8):** The only f-gallows word on the folio. EVA "fodan" -> f(->pr) + o + dan = "prodan". This could relate to Croatian "prodan" (sold, past participle of "prodati"). If so, it would suggest a commercial/transactional context, though this is speculative.

4. **"cstholsi" (L1), "csthi" (L7), "csthor" (L11):** Three words with the bench gallows "ck" pattern. In all cases, the "c" has no independent ZFD mapping and is kept literal. In the f88r pharmaceutical transcription, bench gallows "c" is sometimes interpreted as /h/ (making "ckh" -> "hst"). If applied here: "hstholsi", "hsthi", "hsthor". These alternative readings should be tested against Croatian vocabulary.

5. **"idi" (L3):** A short word parsed as y(->i) + d + y(->i) = "idi". In Croatian, "idi" is the imperative form of "iti" (to go) -- "go!". This could be a genuine imperative in a recipe context ("go [and do X]") or coincidental.

6. **"ostol" in herbal context (L12):** The appearance of "ostol" (bone oil) in the herbal section -- not just the pharmaceutical section -- is significant. It suggests that the herbal folio descriptions include information about how the plant is used in pharmaceutical preparations, creating a cross-reference between sections.

7. **Label "itroain" / "itoain" (L14):** The plant label does not match any known Croatian plant name for cornflower ("razlicak" in modern Croatian, or "modri cvijet"). It may be: (a) a preparation name rather than a plant name; (b) an archaic/dialectal name not in modern dictionaries; (c) a Latinized or hybrid term.

### Comparison with Automated Pipeline
The existing automated transcription (voynich_data/croatian/herbal_a/f2r.txt) was generated by an earlier pipeline version. Key differences from this manual transcription:

1. **Word boundary handling:** The automated pipeline sometimes merged words across plant breaks (e.g., "otrhaliplhain" instead of "otrhal | iplhain"). This transcription preserves word boundaries as marked by EVA periods.

2. **Suffix rule application:** The automated pipeline did not consistently apply the aiin->ain suffix rule (e.g., "kotraiin" instead of "kotrain"). This transcription applies all suffix rules systematically.

3. **Bench gallows convention:** The automated pipeline uses "š" for sh-operator (e.g., "šor" instead of "shor"). This transcription follows the f88r gold-standard convention of keeping "sh" as "sh".

4. **Label gallows expansion:** The automated pipeline produces "itoain" (no t->tr expansion) for the label. This transcription applies t->tr per ZFD rules, producing "itroain", but notes the alternative.

### Confidence Distribution Summary
- **A (validated):** 2 words (ostol, sal) -- 3% of total
- **B (clear morpheme structure):** 36 words -- 49% of total
- **C (systematic but uncertain):** 28 words -- 38% of total
- **D (highly uncertain):** 7 words -- 10% of total

The overall confidence profile is lower than f88r (pharmaceutical), which is expected: herbal body text lacks the dense, repetitive recipe vocabulary that anchors pharmaceutical folio readings. The presence of "ostol" and "sal" in L12 provides a crucial validation anchor.

### Botanical Context
Petersen tentatively identified the f2r plant as **Centaurea cyanus** (cornflower). Historical medicinal uses of cornflower:
- **Febrifuge:** Whole-plant infusion to reduce fever
- **Eye wash:** Flower infusion for eye complaints ("eau de casse-lunettes" in French tradition)
- **Anti-inflammatory:** Used in poultices

The ZFD text's emphasis on soaking (sh-), heating (h-), and oil/substance preparation is broadly consistent with infusion/decoction preparation methods. The "ostol" (bone oil) reference in L12 could indicate that cornflower was combined with bone oil in a compound preparation -- a practice consistent with medieval polypharmacy.
