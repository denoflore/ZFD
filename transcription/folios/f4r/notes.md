# Folio f4r -- Transcription Notes

## Recurring Vocabulary

| ZFD | Count | Lines | Meaning |
|-----|-------|-------|---------|
| dain | 5 | L3, L4, L7, L9, L13 | substance |
| hain | 4 | L2, L3, L12(x2) | heat-substance |
| sol | 3 | L2, L8(x2) | with-oil |
| hol | 2 | L2, L3 | heat-oil |
| hor | 2 | L1, L6 | heat-agent |
| hi | 2 | L3, L4 | heat-adj |
| htrol | 2 | L2, L7 | cook-treat-oil |
| htri | 2 | L4, L8 | cook-treat-adj |
| kotrain | 2 | L3, L7 | which-treat-substance |
| kotrhol | 2 | L3(otrhol), L4 | (which-)treat-heat-oil |
| di | 2 | L5, L6 | give-adj |
| sor | 2 | L8, L10 | with-oil |

"dain" (substance) is the most frequent word, appearing in nearly 40% of lines. The h-family vocabulary (hain, hol, hor, hi, htrol, htri) dominates, consistent with heating/cooking preparation instructions.

## Operator Distribution

| Operator | EVA | ZFD | Count |
|----------|-----|-----|-------|
| ch->h | ch | h | 23 |
| sh->s | sh | s | 10 |
| qo->ko | qo | ko | 7 |
| ot->otr | ot | otr | 1 |
| ok->ost | ok | ost | 1 (uncertain) |

The ch-operator (heat/cook) strongly dominates at 23 instances, consistent with herbal preparation text. The qo-operator appears 7 times, concentrated in L1, L3-L5, L7, L11. The single ok->ost instance (L4 "!okaiin") is uncertain due to the illegible initial character.

## Gallows Distribution

| Gallows | EVA | ZFD | Count |
|---------|-----|-----|-------|
| t->tr | t | tr | 13 |
| k->st | k | st | 2 |
| p->pl | p | pl | 2 |
| f->pr | f | pr | 0 |
| Bench cth->htr | cth | htr | 6 |
| Bench ckh->hst | ckh | hst | 1 |
| Bench cph->hpl | cph | hpl | 2 |
| Bench cfh->hpr | cfh | hpr | 0 |

The t-gallows (->tr, "treat") dominates at 13 instances, well above k-gallows (->st, "bone") at only 2. This is a notable departure from f1r and f2r where k-gallows dominates. Bench gallows cth (->htr) appears 6 times, indicating compound cook-treat terms. No f-gallows or cfh bench gallows appear on this folio.

## Anomalies

1. **Low k-gallows count:** Only 2 standalone k-gallows (L1 "kodalchy", L9 "koraiin"), versus 13 t-gallows. This is the inverse of f1r/f2r where k dominates. May indicate less bone-related vocabulary on this folio.

2. **Unusual -oiin endings (L11, L12):** "kotrhoiin" and "soiin" both end in -oiin, which does not match the standard aiin->ain suffix. The -oiin pattern may represent a different morphological ending or a scribal variant.

3. **"!okaiin" (L4):** Uncertain initial character before ok-operator. If the ok->ost operator applies, this yields "[?]ostain" (bone-substance). The uncertainty prevents confident identification.

4. **"shy!tchy" (L6):** Uncertain character embedded within a multi-operator word. The gap between sh-operator and t-gallows makes full reading speculative.

5. **"tridi" (L5) and "trheai" (L6):** Both words beginning with t-gallows (->tr) at word-initial produce unusual phonotactic results: "tridi" (tr+i+d+i) and "trheai" (tr+h+e+a+i). These dense clusters are rare.

6. **"!s" (L2):** An isolated uncertain fragment between two plant breaks. The shortest "word" on the folio; possibly a scribal abbreviation or damaged text.

7. **No validated gold-standard terms:** Unlike f1r (ostol) and f2r (ostol, sal), f4r contains no A-grade validated terms. The closest candidate is "[?]ostain" (L4) which contains the "ost" (bone) morpheme but is undermined by the uncertain initial.
