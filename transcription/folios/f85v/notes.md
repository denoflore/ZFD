# Folio f85v -- Transcription Notes

## Page Type
Nine-rosette foldout (verso). Part of the largest fold-out in the manuscript. Contains circular diagrams with embedded labels but no continuous text lines.

## EVA Status
No standard text lines in the EVA transcription archive (LSI_ivtff_0d.txt). The foldout's text elements are embedded within the diagram structure and would require manual image-based transcription.

## Priority
Low priority for automated processing. Would benefit from manual paleographic analysis of diagram labels.
