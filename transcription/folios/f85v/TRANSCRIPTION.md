## Notes

This folio is the verso of the nine-rosette foldout (f85v-f86r). The foldout contains circular diagram structures with embedded labels but no continuous text lines. The EVA transcription archive does not include standard text line data for this folio.

Labels and diagram text would need to be transcribed directly from the manuscript image, which is not included in the automated batch processing.
