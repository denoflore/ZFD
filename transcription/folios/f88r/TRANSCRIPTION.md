## Top Register Labels

Labels alternate with 5 root/plant illustrations across the top of the page. The first label is adjacent to a stacked tiered vessel (container illustration).

| Label # | Position | Croatian | English | Conf | EVA |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|------|-----|
| 1 | Container (top vessel) | otrorhetri | treated heated fluid | A | otorchety |
| 2 | Plant [1,1] light roots | oral | by mouth / oral | B | oral |
| 3 | Plant [1,2] dark roots | orald | oral preparation | C | orald |
| 4 | Plant [1,3] mixed roots | oldar | oil-given (oil preparation) | C | oldar |
| 5 | Plant [1,4] dark root w/sprouts | otrosti | of pungency/sharpness | B | otoky |
| 6 | Plant [1,5] light roots, dark leaf | otrali | bitter-substance (adj) | C | otaly |

**Label 1 analysis (VALIDATED):**
EVA `otorchety` → o(topic) + t(→tr) + or + ch(→h) + e + t(→tr) + y(→i) = "o-tror-he-tri" → **otrorhetri** (treated heated fluid). Two gallows expansions (t→tr twice) and one operator cluster (ch→h). All 7 layers converge: pharmaceutical genre (Layer 6), known process vocabulary (Layer 4), valid morphology (Layer 3), confirmed by spatial correlation with apparatus output vessel.

**P1 Interpretation:** This text block describes a pharmaceutical preparation involving bone (ost-) and oil (or/ol), with processes of soaking (sh-), cooking (ch-/h-), and treating (otr-). Salt (sal/sar) is used as an ingredient. The repeated appearance of "kost-" (bone) stems and "or/ol" (oil) terms is consistent with the preparation of bone oil, matching the "ostol" container label above.

## Middle Register Labels

Labels alternate with 5 plant/root illustrations. A second tiered vessel (container) appears at the left.

| Label # | Position | Croatian | English | Conf | EVA |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|------|-----|
| 12 | Container (middle vessel) | otraldi | treated-substance-adj | C | otaldy |
| 13 | Plant [2,1] dark flowers | oram | oil-instrumental (with oil) | B | oram |
| 14 | Plant [2,2] dark roots | dari | given / gifted | B | dary |
| 15 | Plant [2,3] blotchy flower | **ostol** | **bone oil** | **A** | okol |
| 16 | Plant [2,4] hairy root, dark leaf | sorori | sister-plant / related species | C | sorory |
| 17 | Plant [2,5] speckled root | otrida | treated-given | C | otyda |

**Label 15 analysis (VALIDATED):**
EVA `okol` → o(topic/stem) + k(→st) + o + l(noun suffix) = "o-st-o-l" → **ostol** (bone oil). Single gallows expansion (k→st). All 7 layers converge: pharmaceutical genre (Layer 6), known vocabulary (Layer 4: ost=bone + ol=oil), valid morphology (Layer 3), confirmed by Curio adversarial validation and spatial correlation with plant illustration.

**EVA divergence for Label 15:** EVA reads 4 simple characters "o-k-o-l". ZFD reads the k-gallows as a cluster abbreviation for -st-, producing "ostol" (bone oil) -- a meaningful pharmaceutical term that matches the apparatus context.

**P2 Interpretation:** The middle text block continues the pharmaceutical recipe. Key vocabulary: repeated "koosteol/kooestol" (which-bone-oil) = the preparation being described; "sal/sali" (salt/salty) as ingredient; "sheol/dsheol" (soak-oil) = soaking in oil process; "hor/hol" (cook/combine) = heating/cooking steps. The recipe structure is: prepare bone oil (ostol), soak ingredients, cook with salt, combine oils.

## Bottom Register Labels

Three labels with 2 plants. A third tiered vessel (container) appears at the left.

| Label # | Position | Croatian | English | Conf | EVA |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|------|-----|
| 23 | Container (bottom vessel) | oprisstidal | heat-bone-substance | D | ofyskydal |
| 24 | Plant [3,1] with serrated leaves | otror. am | treated fluid. by means of | B | otor.am |
| 25 | Plant [3,2] with dark flower | opraldo | heat-substance-completion | C | ofaldo |

**Label 23 analysis:**
EVA `ofyskydal` is the longest label on the page. Parse: o + f(→pr) + y + s + k(→st) + y + d + a + l → "o-pr-i-s-st-i-d-a-l" → "oprisstidal". This is a compound term, possibly describing the vessel contents. Two gallows expansions (f→pr, k→st). The -dal ending may relate to "dal" (gave/portion). Confidence D due to length and parsing ambiguity.

**P3 Interpretation:** The bottom text block provides final recipe instructions. The repeated "koostol" (which-bone-oil = the bone oil preparation) appears 5 times in 6 lines, indicating this paragraph describes the final steps of the bone oil recipe. Key instructions: "hol" (cook/combine), "dar" (give/administer), "dal" (gave/administered). "dol" may relate to Latin "dolor" (pain) -- suggesting a therapeutic application for pain.

## Illustrations

### Container/Vessel Illustrations (3 total)
1. **Top vessel (L1):** Stacked tiered structure in red and green/teal. 4-5 tiers with decorative elements. Appears to be a distillation or processing apparatus. Label: "otrorhetri" (treated heated fluid).
2. **Middle vessel (L12):** Shorter stacked structure in red/brown with green base. 3 tiers. Label: "otraldi" (treated substance).
3. **Bottom vessel (L23):** Stacked structure in red/brown with ornate base. 4 tiers. Label: "oprisstidal" (complex compound term).

### Root/Plant Illustrations
- **Top row (5 plants):** Various root structures with different coloring (light, dark, mixed). Plants [1,1] through [1,5] showing medicinal roots.
- **Middle row (5 plants):** Similar root structures with different characteristics. One has a "blotchy flower" (the plant labeled "ostol").
- **Bottom row (2 plants):** One with serrated leaves, one with dark flower and green leaves extending to the right margin (largest plant illustration on the page).

### Leaf/Branch Elements
- Green leaf and branch elements in the right margin area
- Some scattered green leaves between registers

## Notes

### Validation
- **Label "ostol" (EVA: okol, #15):** CONFIRMED by Curio adversarial validation. The k-gallows expands to -st-, producing "ostol" (bone oil). This is the gold standard example of gallows-as-abbreviation.
- **Label "otrorhetri" (EVA: otorchety, #1):** CONFIRMED by Curio. Two gallows expansions (both t→tr) plus ch→h cluster. The term describes processed/treated heated fluid, consistent with the output vessel of a pharmaceutical apparatus.

### Recipe Structure
The three text blocks (P1, P2, P3) form a continuous recipe:
1. P1: Ingredients and initial preparation (bone + oil + salt + soaking)
2. P2: Cooking and combining steps (repeated bone-oil references + heating)
3. P3: Final steps and administration (repeated bone-oil + give/administer + pain reference)

### Scribe Behavior
- Labels written in careful register (clear, deliberate letterforms)
- Body text in standard register
- The scribe maintains spatial correlation: labels are positioned near the illustration components they describe
- Currier Hand 4 designation; consistent hand with other pharmaceutical section folios

### EVA Agreement/Divergence Summary
- **Labels:** EVA label readings are consistent across multiple transcribers (H, V, L, K agree on most labels). The key divergence is INTERPRETATION: EVA sees simple character sequences while ZFD reads abbreviation marks.
- **Body text:** Some variation between transcribers H, F, L -- particularly on ambiguous characters (the '!' marks in EVA indicate transcriber uncertainty).
- **Key EVA divergence:** Every gallows character in EVA (k, t, f, p) is a cluster abbreviation in ZFD. This accounts for the appearance of meaningful Croatian/Latin vocabulary where EVA sees only symbol sequences.
