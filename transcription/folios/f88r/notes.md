# Folio f88r -- Transcription Notes

## Key Observations

### Validation Status
This folio contains the two most strongly validated labels in the ZFD framework:
1. **"ostol" (EVA: okol)** -- Bone oil. Validated by Curio adversarial methodology. The k-gallows expands to -st-, producing a meaningful pharmaceutical compound (ost=bone + ol=oil).
2. **"otrorhetri" (EVA: otorchety)** -- Treated heated fluid. Validated by Curio. Two t-gallows expansions (t→tr) plus ch→h operator.

### Recipe Structure
The folio contains a single continuous recipe for bone oil preparation across three text blocks:
- **P1 (lines 7-11):** Ingredients and initial preparation. Salt (sal), bone (ost-), oil (or/ol), soaking (sh-) processes.
- **P2 (lines 18-22):** Processing steps. Cooking (h-/ch-), combining, repeated bone-oil references.
- **P3 (lines 26-31):** Final instructions and therapeutic application. Administration (dar=give), possible pain indication (dol=dolor?).

### Gallows Frequency
This folio is gallows-heavy, consistent with pharmaceutical/recipe content:
- k-gallows (→st): ~25 occurrences across labels and text
- t-gallows (→tr): ~8 occurrences
- f-gallows (→pr): ~4 occurrences
- p-gallows (→pl): ~3 occurrences
- Bench gallows (cth, ckh, cph): ~6 occurrences

The dominance of k-gallows (→st) reflects the repeated "ost-" (bone) stem throughout the recipe.

### Operator Distribution
Word-initial operators observed:
- qo (→ko, "which"): ~12 occurrences, overwhelmingly before "kol/keol" = "which-bone-oil"
- ch (→h, "cook/action"): ~15 occurrences, indicating cooking/preparation steps
- sh (→s, "with/soak"): ~8 occurrences, soaking processes
- d/da (→d/da, "give/to"): ~6 occurrences, recipe instructions
- o (topic): many occurrences, often hard to distinguish from vowel-initial words

### Suffix Distribution
- -y (→i, adjective): most common, appearing in labels and modifiers
- -aiin (→ain, substance): 4 occurrences, marking substance nouns
- -ol (oil): frequent, marking oil-related terms
- -am/-om (instrumental): 4-5 occurrences, marking "by means of" constructions
- -al (substance): 3-4 occurrences

### Anomalies
1. **Line 7 "chckhod":** Complex bench gallows compound at line end. The ch + ckh + od sequence is difficult to parse. Possibly h + hst + od = "hhstod" -- a compound abbreviation for a process completion term.
2. **Label 23 "ofyskydal":** Longest label on the page (9 EVA characters). Contains two gallows (f, k). Possibly a compound vessel-contents description.
3. **Line 21 "dg/dm":** Final characters unclear. H transcription reads "dg", F reads "dm", L reads "dm". The instrumental suffix -m seems more likely in recipe context.
4. **Line 29 "kchor":** Two gallows characters adjacent (k + ch + or). This is unusual and may represent a particularly heavy abbreviation: st + h + or = "sthor" (bone-cook-oil).

### Confidence Distribution
- A: 2 labels (ostol, otrorhetri) -- validated
- B: 14 entries (labels + text lines with clear vocabulary matches)
- C: 10 entries (labels + text lines with multiple possible readings)
- D: 1 entry (label 23, complex compound)

### Spatial Correlation Confirmed
The three container labels are positioned at the left margin adjacent to the stacked vessel illustrations. Root/plant labels are positioned above or adjacent to their respective illustrations. This spatial correlation is consistent across all three registers and supports the pharmaceutical recipe interpretation.
