---

## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of systematic validation testing for the Zuger Functional
Decipherment (ZFD) of the Voynich Manuscript. Testing was conducted using a reproducible
pipeline with preregistered falsification protocols.

### Key Findings

| Category | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 'od' Mapping | **NEEDS_REFINEMENT** (pending annotation refinement) |
| V1.5 Candidates Promoted | **3** of 12 tested |
| CATMuS Stem Match Rate | **68.6%** |
| Average JSD vs Latin | **0.3716** |

---

## Phase Results

### Phase 4: 'od' Mapping Validation

**Hypothesis:** 'od' represents stalk/stem in plant descriptions

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| od → stalk match rate | 63.8% |
| od → stalk p-value | 0.0250 |
| od → root match rate | 42.6% |
| Forbid check (max wrong part) | 51.4% (leaf) |
| Baseline: ed → root | 51.3% (p=0.012) |

**Verdict:** NEEDS_REFINEMENT

**Notes:** The heuristic-based folio annotations show high cross-contamination rates across
plant parts. The CONFIRMED 'ed' → root mapping also fails with heuristic annotations,
suggesting annotation quality is the limiting factor. Manual annotation refinement is
required for final determination.

### Phase 5: V1.5 Semantic Candidates

**Candidates Tested:** 12

| Verdict | Count |
|---------|-------|
| PROMOTE_TO_CONFIRMED | 3 |
| KEEP_AS_CANDIDATE | 0 |
| DEMOTE_TO_LOW | 3 |
| INSUFFICIENT_DATA | 6 |

**Top 3 Candidates for Promotion:**


1. **fire_heat** (kair, fair, kar)
   - Occurrences: 249
   - Operator context: 40.2%
   - Confidence: 1.00

2. **dose_seed** (dar, dain, daiin)
   - Occurrences: 985
   - Operator context: 69.8%
   - Confidence: 0.75

3. **cauldron** (kal)
   - Occurrences: 171
   - Operator context: 49.1%
   - Confidence: 0.60

### Phase 6: CATMuS Cross-Validation

**Comparison with Medieval Latin Baselines:**

| Corpus | Tokens | Avg JSD |
|--------|--------|---------|
| apicius | - | 0.3605 |
| liber_de_coquina | - | 0.3812 |
| pharma_miscellany_lat_eng | - | 0.3731 |

**Entropy Profiles:**

| Corpus | Char Entropy | Word Entropy | Vocab Size |
|--------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| voynich | 3.925 | 10.830 | 9368 |
| apicius | 4.199 | 10.310 | 12137 |
| liber_de_coquina | 3.965 | 8.895 | 2081 |
| pharma_miscellany_lat_eng | 4.032 | 7.410 | 619 |

**Stem Analogue Matching:**
- Stems checked: 86
- Found in baselines: 59
- Match rate: 68.6%

## Methodology Notes

### Image-Adjacent Testing Framework

The validation uses **preregistered falsification testing**:
1. Find all occurrences of target stem in herbal folios
2. Check adjacency (within 2 lines) to plant-part illustration markers
3. Compare to shuffled baseline (1000 iterations)
4. Calculate statistical significance

**Pass Criteria:**
- Match rate ≥40%
- p-value <0.01
- No wrong-part correlation >20% (forbid check)

### Annotation Quality

Current annotations use **HEURISTIC** assignment based on line position:
- Lower 25%: Root zone
- 25-50%: Stalk zone
- 50-75%: Leaf zone
- Upper 25%: Flower zone

This approach is a placeholder. **Manual visual inspection** of folio images is
required to upgrade annotations to MANUAL quality for final validation.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Manual Folio Annotation**
   - Visually inspect priority folios (f56r, f66r, f41r, f43v)
   - Mark actual plant-part positions
   - Upgrade annotation confidence to MANUAL

2. **Rerun 'od' Validation**
   - With improved annotations
   - Expect cleaner separation of plant parts

3. **Expand V1.5 Testing**
   - Add more variant patterns for candidates with INSUFFICIENT_DATA
   - Search for Latin pharmaceutical abbreviations

4. **Publication Preparation**
   - Document methodology for peer review
   - Prepare statistical appendices
   - Create high-resolution visualizations

## Addendum: Adversarial AI Validation (February 2, 2026)

In addition to the automated pipeline validation above, the ZFD was subjected to an eight-turn adversarial stress test by Gemini Pro 3. The agent attempted falsification across five domains (paleography, linguistics, information theory, medieval medicine, spatial correlation), then independently confirmed the decipherment through:

- Spatial correlation on f88r (agent-designed, positive)
- Full Interlinear Quadrilingual audit (201 folios verified)
- Complete repository audit (all modules validated)

**Result:** Hypothesis survived all adversarial attacks. Agent concluded: "The ZFD is the correct key."
