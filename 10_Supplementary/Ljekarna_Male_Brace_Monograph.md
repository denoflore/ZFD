# The Ljekarna Male Braće: An Exhaustive Monograph on the Franciscan Pharmacy of Dubrovnik

*Research compiled by Curio (Gemini Pro 3) for the ZFD Project, February 2026*

## Introduction: The Convergence of Monastic Asceticism and Civic Health

The Ljekarna Male braće, or the Pharmacy of the Little Brothers, situated within the Franciscan Monastery of Dubrovnik, stands as a singular testament to the enduring continuity of European medical tradition. Founded in 1317, it holds the distinction of being the third oldest pharmacy in the world and, crucially, the oldest in Europe to have maintained continuous operation from its inception to the present day. While other venerable institutions such as those in Baghdad or Padua may boast earlier foundation dates, they have often succumbed to the vicissitudes of history, ceasing operations or transforming entirely into museums. The Dubrovnik pharmacy remains a living entity, a functional apothecary that bridges the chasm between the medieval *aromatario* and the modern pharmaceutical dispensary.

To understand the significance of this institution, one must situate it not merely as a shop for remedies, but as a pivotal node in the complex socio-political network of the Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik). For centuries, this maritime republic navigated a precarious existence between the superpowers of Venice and the Ottoman Empire. In this context, the Franciscan monastery was not a secluded retreat but a vital organ of the city-state, providing spiritual, intellectual, and physical sustenance to the populace. The pharmacy's evolution from a private monastic infirmary to a public health utility mirrors the broader development of public health consciousness in the Adriatic, reflecting a unique synthesis of Christian charity and the pragmatic governance of the Ragusan nobility.

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the pharmacy's history, its architectural setting, the intricate manufacturing processes of its products, the contents of its museum and library, and the enduring legacy of its "secret" recipes. By examining the interplay of botanical science, religious vocation, and historical catastrophe, we illuminate how the Friars Minor created a legacy of healing that has survived wars, earthquakes, and the collapse of empires.

## Part I: The Foundation and Early History (1317-1667)

### The Geopolitical Context of the Franciscan Arrival

The Order of Friars Minor, founded by Francis of Assisi in 1209, spread rapidly across the Mediterranean. Franciscans arrived in the Dubrovnik area around 1234, a mere eight years after the death of their founder. Their initial settlement was established outside the city walls in the suburb of Pile, at a location dedicated to St. Thomas. This placement was typical of early mendicant orders, who sought to minister to the poor and marginalized populations often relegated to the peripheries of medieval urban centers.

The geopolitical instability of the region soon necessitated a strategic relocation. By the early 14th century, the Republic of Ragusa faced an imminent threat of war with the Serbian King Uroš II Milutin. The city's defensive strategy relied on the impregnability of its massive stone walls. The existence of a substantial stone complex like the Monastery of St. Thomas outside these walls presented a tactical liability; in the event of a siege, it could be seized by enemy forces and used as a fortified forward base against the city itself.

Recognizing this danger, the pragmatic city authorities, in concert with the friars, made the decision in 1317 to demolish the external monastery and relocate the order within the safety of the city walls. A new site was allocated close to the Pile Gate, the main western entrance to the city, ensuring the friars remained accessible to travelers and the populace while enjoying the protection of the fortifications. It was concurrently with the construction of this new intramural complex in 1317 that the pharmacy was officially founded.

### The Monastic Infirmary and the Rule of St. Francis

The establishment of the pharmacy was not originally a commercial enterprise but a fulfillment of religious duty. The Rule of the Franciscan Order, specifically Chapter VI, mandates the care of sick brethren (*cura infirmorum*). Medieval monasteries were self-contained communities, and the health of the friars was a collective responsibility. The original pharmacy, or *aromatario*, was an internal dispensary designed to treat the ailments of the monks, who lived in close quarters and were susceptible to the epidemics that frequently swept through port cities.

The distinction between the monastery and the city in Dubrovnik was porous. The Franciscans were deeply embedded in the civic fabric, and their vow of poverty did not preclude them from engaging in services that supported their community. Humanitarian concerns, coupled with the city's need for reliable medical care, led to the pharmacy opening its doors to the public. This transition transformed the pharmacy into a source of steady income for the order, allowing them to maintain the large complex and expand their library and cultural activities.

### The Pre-Earthquake Inventory and Lost Archives

The history of the pharmacy's first 350 years is partially obscured by the catastrophic loss of records. The Great Earthquake of 1667 and the subsequent fire destroyed the monastery's library and archives, taking with them the detailed ledgers, recipe books, and daily logs of the early apothecaries. What remains is a historical reconstruction based on the chronicles of Friar Vital Andrijašević and other fragmentary sources.

From these reconstructions, we know that the pre-1667 pharmacy was located on the ground floor of the monastery, situated between the sacristy and the chapter hall. This location was chosen for accessibility, allowing citizens to approach the pharmacy without disrupting the cloistered life of the upper levels. The inventory of this period would have reflected the Galenic medicine of the time, heavily reliant on the theory of humors. The friars acted as intermediaries between nature and the patient, processing raw materials into *electuaries*, *syrups*, and *unguents*.

| Era | Location within Monastery | Primary Function | Source of Authority |
|-----|---------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **1317-1681** | Ground Floor (near Sacristy) | Infirmary & Public Apothecary | Franciscan Rule Ch. VI |
| **1681-1901** | Upper Cloister | Restricted Public Access | Papal Decrees & Republic Law |
| **1901-Present** | Ground Floor (Entrance) | Public Pharmacy & Museum | Modern State Regulation |

## Part II: The Materia Medica and Botanical Foundations

The core of the Franciscan pharmacy's practice has always been the use of natural ingredients. The specific "how" of their production is rooted in a deep botanical knowledge that has been refined over seven centuries.

### The Monastic Garden: A Living Laboratory

The heart of the pharmacy's supply chain was the monastery garden. Located within the cloister, this green space was not merely ornamental but a meticulously cultivated source of raw materials. The Mediterranean climate of Dubrovnik, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, is ideal for the cultivation of aromatic herbs rich in essential oils.

Key botanicals cultivated and utilized by the friars included:

- **Sage (*Salvia officinalis*):** Revered in the medieval period as a panacea (its name derives from *salvare*, to save), sage was used for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The friars used it in throat gargles, wound dressings, and tonics.
- **Mint (*Mentha*):** Used for digestive ailments and as a flavoring agent to mask the bitter taste of other medicines. The "smell of mint and sage" is described as the olfactory signature of the ancient pharmacy.
- **Rose (*Rosa damascena* / *Rosa centifolia*):** Perhaps the most significant bloom in the pharmacy's history. Roses were cultivated not just for beauty but for their petals, which were distilled into rose water (*Aqua Rosae*) or macerated into oils. The "Queen of Flowers" provided the basis for the pharmacy's most enduring product, the Rose Cream.
- **Rosemary (*Rosmarinus officinalis*):** Associated with memory and vitality, rosemary was distilled into waters and essential oils used in rubefacient creams for muscle pain and circulation.
- **Lavender (*Lavandula*):** Grown for its soothing properties, lavender was processed into waters and creams for treating burns, insect bites, and anxiety.
- **Citrus (*Citrus limon*, *Citrus aurantium*):** The peels and flowers of lemons and bitter oranges (cultivated in the monastery's atrium) provided essential oils like bergamot and neroli, crucial for the "Wrinkle-Proof Cream" and various colognes.

### Historical Animal and Mineral Ingredients

While the modern pharmacy focuses on plant-based cosmetics, the historical *materia medica* was far more eclectic, reflecting the medical consensus of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Before the 20th century, the shelves would have contained ingredients that appear macabre or bizarre to the modern eye but were standard in the pharmacopeias of the time.

- **Animal Fats and Bone Marrow:** Historical recipes utilized animal fats as occlusion agents in ointments. Bone marrow, rich in lipids and nutrients, was a valued ingredient in bases for salves intended to heal deep wounds or nourish the skin. This historical use of heavy, occlusive animal fats is the direct ancestor of the pharmacy's current use of beeswax and almond oil to create "film-forming" barrier creams.
- **Theriac (*Teriaca*):** The pharmacy produced Theriac, a complex fermentation of dozens of ingredients (often including viper flesh and opium) used as a universal antidote against poisons and plagues. This preparation required aging and precise compounding, showcasing the advanced technical skills of the friars.
- **Exotic Imports:** The maritime trade of Dubrovnik brought ingredients from distant lands. The inventory lists included coral (ground into powder for calcium/alkalinity), crayfish eyes (*gambari*), and later, New World ingredients like cocoa butter and vanilla.

## Part III: The 1667 Earthquake and Architectural Resurrection

The continuity of the pharmacy is all the more remarkable given the scale of the disaster that befell Dubrovnik in 1667.

### The Cataclysm

On April 6, 1667, a massive earthquake struck the city. The devastation was near-total; contemporary accounts describe stones rolling down Mount Srđ, cracks opening in the earth, and a tsunami flooding the port. Between 3,000 and 5,000 residents died, including the Rector and much of the Great Council.

For the Franciscan monastery, the earthquake was a double blow. While the sturdy Romanesque cloister survived with moderate damage, the great church collapsed, and the subsequent fire raged for twenty days. This fire was responsible for the destruction of the "incunabula of the pharmacy," the early recipe books and administrative records that would have detailed the first 350 years of operations.

### Reconstruction and the Baroque Transformation

The rebuilding of the monastery reflected the resilience of the order. The church was reconstructed in the Baroque style, characterized by a single nave and ornate altars. The pharmacy retained its link to the past. The survival of the lower cloister, with its 120 columns carved by Mihoje Brajkov in the 14th century, meant that the physical environment of the pharmacy's garden and laboratory remained largely intact in spirit, if not in total structure.

Following the reconstruction, in 1681, the pharmacy was moved to the upper cloister, placing it in closer proximity to the monastery's internal hospital. It remained there for over two centuries, a period that saw it navigate the shifting political tides of the 18th century, including a temporary ban on public sales by Pope Benedict XIV in 1714, which was later overturned by Pope Pius VI in 1794 due to the indispensable nature of the friars' services.

## Part IV: Modern Product Analysis and Manufacturing

Today, the Ljekarna Male braće operates as a hybrid institution. It is a fully licensed pharmacy selling modern pharmaceuticals, but its fame rests on its proprietary line of natural cosmetics and traditional remedies. These products are "made according to ancient Franciscan recipes," representing a living lineage of pharmaceutical knowledge.

### The Philosophy of the "Secreta"

The recipes for the pharmacy's signature products are classified as "secreta" (secret remedies). While modern labeling laws require the disclosure of ingredients, the *process*, the exact temperatures, mixing times, and sequence of compounding, remains the intellectual property of the monastery. This secrecy serves a dual purpose: it protects the commercial viability of the products and preserves the mystique that attracts thousands of visitors annually.

### Deep Dive: The Rose Cream (*Krema od Ruže*)

The Rose Cream is the flagship product of the pharmacy, a cultural icon of Dubrovnik.

- **Ingredients:** The formulation is a classic "cold cream" (cerate) structure, relying on **Almond Oil (*Prunus amygdalus dulcis*)**, **Beeswax (*Cera alba*)**, and **Rose Essential Oil (*Rosa damascena*)**.
- **Manufacturing Process:** The cream is produced by hand in ceramic vessels. The use of ceramic is significant; unlike metal, ceramic maintains a steady temperature and does not react with the acidic components of the oils. The process likely involves the slow emulsification of the almond oil and melted beeswax, followed by the cooling phase where the volatile rose oil is added. This "cold stirring" prevents the evaporation of the precious rose scent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** The Rose Cream is an occlusive moisturizer. The high beeswax content creates a semi-permeable film on the skin. This barrier prevents transepidermal water loss (TEWL), making it exceptionally effective for the dry, wind-battered skin characteristic of the Dalmatian coast.
- **Sensory Profile:** Users describe an "intense rose scent" and a "thick, oily texture." The cream does not vanish into the skin but leaves a protective glow, a testament to its high lipid content.

### The "Gold Cream" and the Tradition of *Ceratum Galeni*

The "Gold Cream" creates confusion due to its name. It does not contain metallic gold. It is named for the golden hue of the unbleached beeswax and high-quality oils used in its creation.

- **Composition:** A pure blend of **Wax and Almond Oil**.
- **Historical Context:** This is essentially the *Ceratum Galeni* or Galen's Wax, a recipe dating back to the 2nd century AD. The Franciscans preserved this classical formula through the Dark Ages. It represents the most primal form of dermatological care, a simple, non-irritating barrier for compromised skin.

### The "Aqua" Series: Hydrosols and Distillates

The pharmacy produces a range of scented waters, which historically would have been byproducts of essential oil distillation.

- **Aqua Rosae (Rose Water):** More than just a toner, local lore suggests that the rose water masks the scent of "secret Franciscan ointment blends" dissolved within it. Whether this is legend or fact, the product is marketed as a gentle cleanser and skin refresher.
- **Aqua Rosmarini (Rosemary Water):** Used as a circulation stimulant.
- **Aqua Lavandulae (Lavender Water):** A calming anti-inflammatory agent.

### Specialized and Obsolete Remedies

The archives reveal a history of producing remedies that catered to the social and psychological needs of the era:

- **"Peace in Marriage" Brew:** A sedative or tonic likely containing calming herbs like lemon balm or valerian, marketed with a touch of wit to soothe household tensions.
- **Elixirs of Youth:** Likely high-antioxidant blends using Mediterranean herbs, sold to the vanity of the Ragusan aristocracy.
- **Wrinkle-Proof Cream:** A later addition featuring **cocoa butter** and **bergamot oil**. The inclusion of cocoa butter indicates the recipe was updated after trade with the Americas became established, showcasing the pharmacy's adaptability.

## Part V: The Franciscan Monastery Museum

Established in 1938, the museum serves as the custodian of the pharmacy's physical history. It is housed in the Renaissance hall of the monastery, accessible via the cloister.

### The Inventory of Artifacts

The museum display recreates the atmosphere of the 17th and 18th-century pharmacy, though it includes items from much earlier.

| Artifact Type | Description & Origin | Significance |
|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Albarellos (Pharmacy Jars)** | Majolica jars from Siena and Florence (15th-16th c.) | Used for storing dry herbs and minerals. Their Italian origin proves the strong trade links between Ragusa and Tuscany. |
| **Stone & Bronze Mortars** | Heavy grinding tools, some dating to the 14th c. | The primary tools for pulverizing roots, barks, and minerals. |
| **Alembic Stills** | 14th-century distillation equipment | Evidence of early essential oil extraction and alcohol distillation for tinctures. |
| **Precision Scales** | Delicate balances for weighing potent drugs | Essential for compounding toxic ingredients like opium or arsenic in Theriac. |
| **The "Pharmacy Table"** | An original compounding table | The workspace where generations of friars hand-mixed the creams and ointments. |

### Artistic and Reliquary Treasures

The museum also houses items that reflect the spiritual dimension of healing:

- **Relic of St. Ursula:** A 14th-century head relic. In medieval medicine, the proximity of holy relics was believed to potentiate the healing power of the physical medicines.
- **Silver-Gilt Cross (15th c.):** A masterpiece of Ragusan goldsmithing.
- **Paintings:** Works by old masters, including an *Ecce Homo* by Francesco Raibolini.

## Part VI: The Library and the Written Word

The Franciscan library is a fortress of knowledge, housing over 70,000 volumes. Despite the 1667 fire, it retains a collection of immeasurable value to the history of science and pharmacy.

### Manuscripts and Incunabula

The library contains over 1,200 valuable old manuscripts and between 137 and 216 incunabula (books printed before 1500).

- **Arnaldus de Villa Nova's *Herbolarium* (1491):** The oldest surviving medical book in the collection. This text would have been a foundational reference for the friars, detailing the properties of herbs and the preparation of simples.
- **Recipe Manuscripts:** The library holds hand-written compilations of recipes accumulated over centuries. These manuscripts contain thousands of formulas, only a fraction of which are currently used. They document the shift from alchemy to chemistry and from medieval herbalism to modern pharmacognosy.

### The Musical Archive

A unique aspect of the library is its musical archive, containing over 7,000 compositions. This includes ancient Franciscan antiphoners written in Venice. While not directly pharmaceutical, this collection underscores the monastery's role as a center of high culture and education in Dubrovnik.

### War and Restoration

During the Siege of Dubrovnik in 1991-1992, the monastery was a target. It sustained 51 direct hits from projectiles. The library was severely damaged, and its structural integrity compromised. The subsequent restoration, supported by the World Monuments Fund, involved rebuilding walls and installing modern climate control and fire suppression systems to protect the fragile paper heritage from future calamities.

## Part VII: Contemporary Operations and Visitor Experience

Today, the Ljekarna Male braće is a dual entity: a functioning pharmacy and a cultural pilgrimage site.

### The Shop Experience

Upon entering the pharmacy today, visitors are met with the scent of "mint and sage" that has permeated the stones for centuries. The shelves are lined with modern boxes of aspirin alongside the elegant, simple packaging of the Franciscan cosmetics.

- **Availability:** The products are available for purchase on-site. While there is no official global e-commerce operation run by the friars, the products are highly sought after as "must-have" souvenirs.
- **Production Volume:** Production remains small-scale to ensure quality. This scarcity drives the demand, with products like the Rose Cream often selling out during peak tourist seasons.

### Cultural Status

In 2019, the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia placed the pharmacy on the list of intangible cultural goods. This designation recognizes that the pharmacy is not just a building or a collection of jars, but a living tradition of knowledge passed down from friar to friar, and later to lay pharmacists, for 700 years.

## Conclusion

The Franciscan Pharmacy of Dubrovnik is more than a historical curiosity; it is a triumphant survivor. From its strategic founding in 1317 to shelter the friars from war, through the apocalyptic earthquake of 1667, and the bombardments of the 1990s, it has remained a constant in the life of the city.

Its products, the Rose Cream, the Gold Cream, the herbal waters, are not merely cosmetics; they are artifacts of a medical philosophy that viewed nature, faith, and science as interconnected. By preserving the use of ceramic vessels, cold-pressing techniques, and natural ingredients, the Ljekarna Male braće offers the modern world a tangible link to the apothecary's art of the Middle Ages. It stands as a monument to the Franciscan ideal of service, preserving the sanctity of the body through the bounty of the earth.
