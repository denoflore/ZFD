# ZFD Blind Decode Falsification Test Requirements
#
# This test uses only Python standard library modules.
# No external dependencies are required.
#
# Required Python version: 3.8+
#
# Standard library modules used:
# - hashlib (checksumming)
# - json (data serialization)
# - random (shuffling)
# - statistics (mean, stdev)
# - datetime (timestamps)
# - pathlib (file paths)
# - argparse (CLI)
# - sys, os (system operations)
#
# The test also imports the ZFD pipeline from zfd_decoder/src/
# which has its own dependencies.
