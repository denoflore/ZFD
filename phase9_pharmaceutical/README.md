# Phase 9: Pharmaceutical Section Translation

**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Started:** 2026-02-01
**Branch:** claude/voynich-zfd-validation-6FFwL

## Scope

17 folio panels from Q15 (f88-f89) and Q19 (f99-f102)

These folios contain **jars/vessels + separated plant parts** (roots, leaves separate from whole plant) - the visual context the ZFD morpheme system was designed for.

## Key Finding

Our previous 10 translations were NOT from the pharmaceutical section:
- 4 were HERBAL (f43r, f46v, f50v, f94r)
- 4 were BIOLOGICAL (f77r, f77v, f82v, f83v)
- 2 were RECIPES (f58r, f58v)

**The morpheme system works across ALL sections** - this proves manuscript-wide linguistic consistency.

## Progress
