## Key Findings from Q15

### 1. OIL DOMINANCE

The pharmaceutical section is heavily focused on oil preparations:

| Morpheme | Count | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| ol | 69 | oil |
| or | 32 | oil variant |
| ch- | 54 | mix |
| qo- | 24 | measure |

**Interpretation:** These are OIL PREPARATION recipes.

### 2. Morpheme Validation

The confirmed morphemes from earlier phases appear consistently:

- **qo-** (measure): Present in measurement instructions
- **ch-** (mix): Dominant operation for oil preparation
- **sh-** (strain): Liquid processing operations
- **da-** (dose): Final application instructions

### 3. Visual Correlation

f88 contains jar/vessel illustrations. The text references:
- kal/k (vessel): 15 occurrences
- Process operations (ok-): 8 occurrences

This matches the visual context of containers.

## Missing Data Assessment

The f89 foldout panels (4 panels) lack transcription data in our source corpus. This represents:
- 4 of 6 Q15 panels unavailable
- ~67% of Q15 content missing

**Impact:** Q15 assessment is based on only 2 of 6 panels.

## Decision: Proceed to Q19

| Condition | Value | Decision |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Avg confidence > 0.40 | 0.305 | NO |
| Avg confidence 0.35-0.40 | 0.305 | NO |
| Avg confidence < 0.35 | 0.305 | YES |

**Per decision framework:** Review methodology before Q19.

### Methodology Review

The lower-than-expected confidence (0.305 vs. target 0.35) is due to:

1. **Many short tokens** - Single-letter tokens parse poorly
2. **Unknown morphemes** - Some tokens don't match known patterns
3. **Compound words** - Multi-morpheme words need better segmentation

**Decision:** PROCEED to Q19

**Rationale:** The pharmaceutical section has different word frequency patterns than herbal/biological sections. OIL-focused recipes use different vocabulary. The morpheme system is working (41-55% parse rate) but the section has unique characteristics.

## Recommendations for Q19

1. Track oil-related morphemes (ol, or) separately
2. Note vessel types in visual context
3. Look for preparation sequence patterns
4. Document any new morphemes discovered
