## Visual Context


**Visual Content (f88r):**
- Pharmaceutical section opener
- Jars/containers with plant material
- Some containers appear to hold liquid
- Plant parts (roots, leaves) shown separately from containers

**Expected correlations:**
- kal (vessel): Should appear frequently
- al/ar (liquid/heat methods): Expected
- ed/od (plant parts): Visible in illustrations
